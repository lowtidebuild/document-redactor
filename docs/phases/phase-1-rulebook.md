# Phase 1 — Comprehensive rulebook (Codex delegation brief)

> ⚠️ **PARTIAL DRAFT — DO NOT EXECUTE** ⚠️
>
> This brief is **incomplete** as of 2026-04-12 (v6, after session +3 first half).
> § 0–11 are written (orientation, mission, invariants, architecture, file
> layout, framework type extensions, runner extensions, detect-all.ts pipeline,
> financial rules, temporal rules, and entities rules). The remaining rule
> content (§ 12–14 structural / legal / heuristics) and § 15–18 (testing /
> TDD / verification / acceptance) are **NOT YET AUTHORED**.
>
> **Do NOT hand this to Codex for execution in its current state.** Codex would
> read the file-layout section, fail to find rule specifications in § 12–14,
> and produce garbage code trying to fill in the gaps.
>
> **If you are Claude in a future session:** jump to the `## RESUME POINTER` section
> at the very bottom of this file. It tells you exactly where to pick up writing.
>
> **If you are the user:** this file will be completed across 2 more Claude
> sessions. Decisions are locked (see session log 2026-04-11-v2). The next step is
> writing § 12 (structural parsers, ~900 lines — different shape from regex
> rules, requires RULES_GUIDE § 5 as reference), then § 13 (legal, ~400 lines),
> then § 14 (heuristics + role blacklists, ~700 lines — requires RULES_GUIDE
> § 6 as reference), followed by § 15–18.

## 0. How to read this document

This is a **self-contained task specification** for the complete Phase 1 rulebook. Read the whole thing before touching any code. Every decision has been made during an architectural review (see [session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md](../../document-redactor-private-notes/session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md) for the review record). Your job is to execute, not to re-debate.

### Sections in this document

0. How to read this document
1. Mission statement (one paragraph — the point of all this)
2. Required reading (files you MUST read before writing code)
3. Invariants (hard constraints you MUST NOT violate)
4. Architecture (3-phase runner, strangler-fig API, decided during review)
5. File layout (exact tree you will create — 22 new files)
6. Type extensions in `_framework/types.ts` (after StructuralDefinition rename)
7. Runner extensions (`_framework/runner.ts` — exact TypeScript with ASCII diagram)
8. `detect-all.ts` new pipeline (with Analysis shape extension for `engine.ts`)
9. `rules/financial.ts` — 10 regex rules (KRW, USD, foreign, percentage, fraction)
10. `rules/temporal.ts` — 8 regex rules (Korean/ISO/English dates, durations)
11. `rules/entities.ts` — 12 regex rules (corporate suffixes, titles, honorifics)
12. `rules/structural/` — 5 parsers (definition, signature, party, recitals, header)
13. `rules/legal.ts` — 6 regex rules (Korean + English case numbers, courts, statutes)
14. `rules/heuristics/` — 4 heuristics + 2 role blacklist data files
15. Testing requirements (per-file minimum counts, quality rubric, 475+ new tests)
16. TDD sequence (phase 1's 18 steps, commit at each step)
17. Verification commands (ship gate)
18. Gotchas + out-of-scope + acceptance criteria + handback contract + error handling

### Decisions locked during plan-eng-review (2026-04-11)

These decisions are not up for debate. If you feel tempted to change them, re-read the session log's review section.

| Ref | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1.1A** Strangler-fig API | New `detect-all.ts` alongside legacy `detect-pii.ts`. Legacy untouched. `engine.ts` migration in one commit at end of Phase 1. | Preserves Phase 0 characterization ship gate (T18 fixture snapshot stays valid). Minimal diff. |
| **1.2A** `StructuralDefinition` not `DefinedTerm` | Framework type is `StructuralDefinition` per the renamed Phase 0 brief. `propagation/defined-terms.ts` stays untouched (separate concept: Lane C role-word classifier). | Avoids name collision and conceptual drift. Phase 0 invariant #2 preserved. |
| **1.3D** UI in separate brief | Phase 1 brief is detection-only. `engine.ts` gets minimal `Analysis` shape extension (new `nonPiiCandidates` field). `CandidatesPanel.svelte` untouched. UI redesign happens in a separate brief after Phase 1 merge + empirical real-document feedback. | v1.0 UI scope-out principle upheld. Rule quality validated before UI is designed around it. |
| **1.4E-1** Fail-loud | No try/catch in runner/parser/heuristic invocation. A throwing rule surfaces as a stack trace, not a silent miss. | Zero-miss invariant (design-v1 Lock-in #15). Matches v1.0 behavior. |
| **2.2** File splits | Single-file for financial, temporal, entities, legal. Subdirectory for structural (5 parsers) and heuristics (4 heuristics). Aggregation via `index.ts`. | Keeps per-file LOC under 500. Avoids premature abstraction for small files. |
| **ReDoS** ReDoS guard expansion | `redos-guard.test.ts` fuzzes regex rules (50ms budget) AND parsers + heuristics (100ms budget). | Parsers and heuristics can have internal regexes with backtracking. |

### What this document is NOT

- Not a rationale document. The review happened before this. If you want the why, read the session log referenced above.
- Not a research document. Every rule below is specified with exact regex source, exact test cases, exact rationale. You do not need to "choose" patterns.
- Not a sandbox. This is production code that ships in v1.1.
- Not a place to improve existing rules. Phase 0 identifiers rules stay untouched per Phase 0 invariants. Tighten in a future hygiene phase.

---

## 1. Mission statement

Add the complete rulebook to the document-redactor detection framework: 46 new detection items across 6 categories (financial / temporal / entities / structural / legal / heuristics), wire them into a new 3-phase runner (structural → regex → heuristics), expose a new parallel detection API at `src/detection/detect-all.ts`, and migrate `src/ui/engine.ts` to use it. All while preserving Phase 0 characterization tests byte-for-byte.

**Zero legacy behavior change.** Phase 0 characterization T1–T18 must all still pass on the exact same `buildTargetsFromZip()` API — because `detect-pii.ts` is untouched by this brief. The new pipeline lives alongside.

**Production, not sandbox.** Every rule ships in v1.1. Every rule has full test coverage (positive / variant / boundary / reject / ReDoS adversarial). The target is ≥90% auto-detection coverage on real contracts (Phase 5 measurement).

Expected deliverables: **22 new files**, **~475-550 new test cases**, **12-15 commits**, **zero npm dependencies**, **zero edits to Phase 0 characterization or integration tests**, and a post-port test count of **~1000 passing**.

---

## 2. Required reading (in order)

Read in this order. Earlier entries win on conflict.

1. **`docs/RULES_GUIDE.md`** (1195 lines) — binding convention spec. Especially:
   - § 2 Taxonomy — 7 categories with boundary resolution rules. Phase 1 fills categories 2–7.
   - § 3 Rule shapes — RegexRule, StructuralParser, Heuristic. Phase 1 exercises all three.
   - § 4 10-step regex rule walkthrough — follow for every regex rule.
   - § 5 Writing a structural parser — follow for every parser in § 12.
   - § 6 Writing a heuristic — especially § 6.2 required behaviors. **Every heuristic MUST consume `structuralDefinitions` + `priorCandidates` + apply role blacklist.**
   - § 7 ReDoS audit checklist — manual + automated. Every new regex goes through this.
   - § 8 Testing convention — minimum per-rule test sets, quality rubric. Migration parity protocol does NOT apply here (Phase 1 is adding new rules, not refactoring existing ones).
   - § 9 Dedup and boundary semantics — critical for `buildAllTargetsFromZip`.
   - § 10 Level/tier mapping — decides which rules run at Conservative vs Standard vs Paranoid.
   - § 11 Language handling — how to wire language filtering into the new runner.
   - § 12 Anti-patterns — every item flagged here must be avoided. Especially **12.1 `\b` in CJK**, **12.2 hardcoded entity names**, **12.4 returning normalized bytes**, **12.9 early dedupe**.
   - § 13 Rule catalog — the living list. Phase 1 fills § 13.2–13.5.

2. **`docs/phases/phase-0-framework-port.md`** (after rename at commit `187b7f8`) — your predecessor brief. Especially:
   - § 6 Type definitions — your starting point. Phase 1 extends this (§ 6 of this brief).
   - § 9 Runner implementation — `runRegexPhase` that Phase 1 extends with structural + heuristic phases.
   - § 12a Characterization tests — these tests MUST still pass after Phase 1.
   - § 19 Acceptance criteria — Phase 0 acceptance must be preserved; Phase 1 criteria are additive.

3. **`src/detection/_framework/types.ts`** — after Phase 0 merges, this file exists with the renamed `StructuralDefinition`. Your Phase 1 work adds zero new types to this file (see § 6 of this brief).

4. **`src/detection/_framework/runner.ts`** — Phase 0 delivers `runRegexPhase`. Phase 1 extends with `runStructuralPhase`, `runHeuristicPhase`, `runAllPhases`, and optional `{ language }` param.

5. **`src/detection/_framework/registry.ts`** — Phase 0 delivers `ALL_REGEX_RULES` with 8 identifiers. Phase 1 extends to include new categories (and also exposes `ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS`, `ALL_HEURISTICS`).

6. **`src/detection/rules/identifiers.ts`** — Phase 0 delivers this. Phase 1 DOES NOT modify it. New categories get new files.

7. **`src/detection/normalize.ts`** — `normalizeForMatching(text)` returns `PositionMap`. Used by every rule in every phase.

8. **`src/detection/extract-text.ts`** — `extractTextFromZip(zip)` walks all scopes. Used by `detectAllInZip`.

9. **`src/propagation/defined-terms.ts`** — **DO NOT MODIFY**. This is Lane C's role-word classifier. It has a type called `DefinedTerm` that is NOT the same as framework's `StructuralDefinition`. Understand the distinction before writing any code that interacts with either.

10. **`src/propagation/propagate.ts`** and **`src/propagation/definition-clauses.ts`** — Lane C variant propagation and the English-only definition clause parser. DO NOT MODIFY. Phase 1 structural parsers (definition-section.ts) include a full Korean + English implementation — they coexist with, do not replace, the existing Lane C parser. (Consolidation is deferred post-Phase-1.)

11. **`src/ui/engine.ts`** — the Lane E engine wrapper. Phase 1's final commit migrates this file from `buildTargetsFromZip` to `buildAllTargetsFromZip`, and extends the `Analysis` type shape with `nonPiiCandidates`. Only TypeScript — no Svelte.

12. **`src/ui/engine.test.ts`** — 17 tests that will migrate along with engine.ts. You must preserve every existing test case's behavior while allowing the new `nonPiiCandidates` field on `Analysis`.

13. **`tests/fixtures/bilingual_nda_worst_case.docx`** — THE fixture. `detect-all.integration.test.ts` runs against it. You do NOT modify this file.

14. **`../document-redactor-private-notes/design-v1.md`** § "Eng Review Lock-in" #1–#15. Binding invariants. Especially #4 (3-tier redaction levels), #11 (Readability target renegotiated per RULES_GUIDE § 1 to be per-category), #13 (ReDoS prevention, now extended to parsers/heuristics).

15. **`../document-redactor-private-notes/session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md`** — the plan-eng-review record that produced this brief. Read the 5 architecture findings to understand why the decisions in § 0 are locked.

## 3. Invariants (DO NOT VIOLATE)

These are non-negotiable. Each violation fails the phase.

1. **All 422 v1.0 legacy tests + 137 Phase 0 new tests must still pass** when you finish. `bun run test` must show `Tests N passed` where N is ≥ 559 + Phase 1 additions. If any existing test breaks, you have regressed. Do NOT skip, suppress, disable, or modify existing tests from earlier phases. The ONLY file from earlier phases that Phase 1 modifies is `src/ui/engine.ts` (and its test, to allow the new optional field on `Analysis`).

2. **No changes to Phase 0 files except extension:** you may APPEND to `_framework/runner.ts`, `_framework/registry.ts`, `_framework/types.ts`, and `_framework/redos-guard.test.ts`. You may NOT rename, reorder, or delete anything in those files that Phase 0 created. Think "add new exports, add new tests, extend" — never "rewrite".

3. **No changes to `src/detection/patterns.ts` or `src/detection/detect-pii.ts`** — legacy shim from Phase 0 stays untouched. If you feel tempted to "clean up the shim", STOP. That's Phase 2 or later.

4. **No changes to `src/detection/detect-pii.characterization.test.ts`** — the 18 characterization tests from Phase 0 are the ship gate. They must still pass byte-for-byte after Phase 1.

5. **No changes to `src/detection/detect-pii.integration.test.ts`** — legacy integration test continues to pass unchanged.

6. **No changes to `src/propagation/` or `src/docx/` or `src/finalize/`** — these lanes are downstream consumers or upstream preprocessors. Phase 1 does NOT touch them.

7. **No changes to `src/ui/` other than `engine.ts` and `engine.test.ts`** — no touching Svelte components. UI redesign is a separate brief.

8. **No changes to `package.json` dependencies.** No npm installs.

9. **No changes to Vite config, ESLint config, tsconfig.json, svelte.config.js.** If TypeScript or ESLint complain about your code, fix your code.

10. **Use `.js` extension in imports** (per tsconfig `allowImportingTsExtensions` + Vite convention).

11. **Use `import type` for type-only imports** (`verbatimModuleSyntax: true`).

12. **Use `!` or explicit checks for array access** (`noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`).

13. **Every new regex MUST be bounded and pass the ReDoS guard.** See RULES_GUIDE § 7 for the checklist. The guard test (`_framework/redos-guard.test.ts`) runs fuzz with 50ms budget per regex rule and 100ms budget per parser / heuristic. A rule that fails must be redesigned, not excluded.

14. **Every heuristic MUST consume `HeuristicContext.structuralDefinitions` + `priorCandidates` + apply role blacklist.** Per RULES_GUIDE § 6.2. This is a safety invariant — heuristics without D9 awareness break the "The Buyer" user experience.

15. **Original-byte recovery via `origOffsets` is load-bearing.** Every phase that produces `Candidate[]` must use `normalizeForMatching` offset map to slice the ORIGINAL unnormalized substring for `candidate.text`. Never return normalized bytes. See RULES_GUIDE § 12.4.

16. **Fail-loud.** No try/catch in the runner, in phase functions, or around individual rule/parser/heuristic invocation. If something throws, let it bubble up as a stack trace. See [session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md](../../document-redactor-private-notes/session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md) Finding 1.4E-1.

17. **New pipeline is parallel, not replacement.** `detect-all.ts` and `detect-pii.ts` coexist. Legacy shim continues working. The ONLY caller migration is `engine.ts` at the final commit.

18. **`StructuralDefinition` ≠ `DefinedTerm`.** They are TWO different types in TWO different files. Do not import the wrong one. Do not "consolidate" them.

19. **Do not `git push`.** Commit locally only. The user reviews and pushes.

20. **Do not modify `tests/fixtures/`** — fixture generation is out of scope.

21. **Do not add network code.** ESLint bans `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `WebSocket`, `EventSource`, dynamic `import()`, `navigator.sendBeacon`. Any violation fails the lint step.

```

**Key properties of this pipeline:**

1. **Normalization runs ONCE per call.** All three phases see the same `PositionMap`. Parsers and heuristics that need to scan the text use the same offset map for original-byte recovery.

2. **Structural phase runs first, on purpose.** Its output (`StructuralDefinition[]`) becomes part of `HeuristicContext`, so heuristics can skip defined labels (D9 policy).

3. **Regex phase is ignorant of context.** Each rule is stateless. Uses the same semantics as Phase 0's `runRegexPhase`.

4. **Heuristic phase runs last.** Consumes both prior outputs. Applies role blacklist. Produces `Candidate[]` with confidence scores (<1.0).

5. **No dedup until the end.** The runner returns overlapping/duplicate candidates freely. Dedup happens only in `buildAllTargetsFromZip` (the final target materialization step). See RULES_GUIDE § 12.9 anti-pattern.

6. **Fail-loud at every step.** No try/catch. If a parser throws, the whole call throws.

7. **Language filtering is optional per-phase.** When `runAllPhases` is called with `{ language: "ko" }`, every phase filters out rules whose `languages` array excludes `"ko"` and does not include `"universal"`. When called without `{ language }`, all rules run (this matches Phase 0 legacy behavior and is how `detect-pii.ts` shim stays unchanged).

### 4.2 Strangler-fig API — new `detect-all.ts`

```
Legacy (Phase 0, unchanged):
  patterns.ts          (shim exporting PII_KINDS, PII_PATTERNS)
  detect-pii.ts        (shim exporting detectPii, detectPiiInZip, buildTargetsFromZip)
  detect-pii.characterization.test.ts  (Phase 0 ship gate)
  detect-pii.integration.test.ts       (legacy integration)
  detect-pii.test.ts                   (legacy behavioral)

NEW (Phase 1):
  detect-all.ts        (new API: detectAll, detectAllInZip, buildAllTargetsFromZip)
  detect-all.test.ts   (new behavioral tests)
  detect-all.integration.test.ts  (new integration, worst-case + synthetic fixtures)
```

The two APIs run independently. Legacy shim keeps working for the 422 legacy tests + 18 Phase 0 characterization tests. The new `detect-all.ts` is what engine.ts will call after migration.

### 4.3 `engine.ts` migration (Phase 1 final commit)

At the END of Phase 1, a single commit migrates `src/ui/engine.ts` from legacy to new API:

**Before (Phase 0 state):**
```typescript
import { buildTargetsFromZip } from "../detection/detect-pii.js";

export interface Analysis {
  entityGroups: EntityGroup[];
  piiCandidates: PiiCandidate[];
  stats: { /* ... */ };
}

export async function analyzeZip(bytes: Uint8Array, seeds: string[]): Promise<Analysis> {
  // uses buildTargetsFromZip
}
```

**After (Phase 1 state):**
```typescript
import { buildAllTargetsFromZip } from "../detection/detect-all.js";
// buildTargetsFromZip still importable but no longer called in production path

export interface Analysis {
  entityGroups: EntityGroup[];
  piiCandidates: PiiCandidate[];
  /** NEW: non-PII matches from Phase 1 rules (financial, temporal, entities, legal, structural, heuristics) */
  nonPiiCandidates: readonly NonPiiCandidate[];
  stats: { /* ... */ };
}

export interface NonPiiCandidate {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly ruleId: string;
  readonly category: "financial" | "temporal" | "entities" | "legal" | "structural" | "heuristics";
  readonly confidence: number;
}

export async function analyzeZip(bytes: Uint8Array, seeds: string[]): Promise<Analysis> {
  // uses buildAllTargetsFromZip; maps some results to entityGroups/piiCandidates
  // (for backward compat with existing UI), remainder to nonPiiCandidates
}
```

**Behavior contract of the migration:**
- `entityGroups` and `piiCandidates` continue to contain what they previously contained. Test cases that assert on these keep passing.
- `nonPiiCandidates` is a NEW field that the UI does not yet render (that's the UI redesign brief's job). But `defaultSelections(analysis)` DOES include them — so `applyRedaction` will redact them when the user clicks Apply.
- The `Set<string>` returned by `defaultSelections` now includes every entry from `nonPiiCandidates.text` as well.
- `engine.test.ts` gets one new test: `"analyzeZip populates nonPiiCandidates for financial matches in a contract"`. All existing tests continue to pass unchanged.

### 4.4 Three shape-decision summary

From the review findings:

| Decision | Chosen |
|---|---|
| 1.1 Parallel API | **A — Strangler-fig** (new detect-all.ts alongside legacy) |
| 1.2 DefinedTerm naming | **A — rename in framework to StructuralDefinition** (Phase 0 brief already fixed) |
| 1.3 UI migration scope | **D — Phase 1 is detection-only**, UI redesign in separate brief post-Phase-1 merge |
| 1.4E Error handling | **1 — Fail-loud** (no try/catch, exceptions bubble up) |
| ReDoS guard | Expand to parsers (100ms) + heuristics (100ms) |

**Counts:**
- **New files**: 34 (22 rule/parser/heuristic files + 12 tests)
- **Modified files**: 6 (`_framework/types.ts`, `_framework/types.test.ts`, `_framework/runner.ts`, `_framework/runner.test.ts`, `_framework/registry.ts`, `_framework/redos-guard.test.ts`, `src/ui/engine.ts`, `src/ui/engine.test.ts`)
- Wait, that's 8 modified. Correction: 8 modified files. Ignore the earlier count.
- **Unchanged but critical**: every Phase 0 file (`identifiers.ts`, `luhn.ts`, their tests, and all 5 characterization/integration/behavioral legacy tests)

**Create directories first:**

```bash
mkdir -p src/detection/rules/structural src/detection/rules/heuristics
```

---

## 6. Type extensions in `_framework/types.ts`

**Phase 1 adds ZERO new exported types to `_framework/types.ts`.** Every type Phase 1 needs — `Level`, `Language`, `Category`, `PostFilter`, `RegexRule`, `StructuralDefinition`, `StructuralParser`, `Candidate`, `HeuristicContext`, `Heuristic` — was already defined by Phase 0. The authoritative source is `docs/phases/phase-0-framework-port.md` § 6, which ships the exact file content. Phase 1 does NOT re-export, re-name, or extend any of those symbols in `types.ts`.

This section is short on purpose: its only job is to enumerate what Phase 0 already delivered and guard against the "helpful cleanup" instinct. If you feel tempted to add a `RunOptions`, `DocumentLanguage`, `DetectAllResult`, `NonPiiCandidate`, or `Phase` type to `types.ts`, **stop** and re-read § 6.2.

### 6.1 What Phase 0 already delivered

After Phase 0 merges, `src/detection/_framework/types.ts` exports the following 10 symbols (exact names, exact shapes — if any of these is missing or renamed, Phase 0 regressed and you must fix Phase 0 before continuing Phase 1):

| Export | Kind | Phase 1 usage |
|---|---|---|
| `Level` | type alias | `"conservative" \| "standard" \| "paranoid"` — used by every new rule's `levels` field |
| `Language` | type alias | `"ko" \| "en" \| "universal"` — used by every new rule's `languages` field |
| `Category` | type alias | 7-way union — Phase 1 fills `"financial"`, `"temporal"`, `"entities"`, `"structural"`, `"heuristics"`, `"legal"` |
| `PostFilter` | type alias | `(normalizedMatch: string) => boolean` — reused by ~3 new regex rules (KRW range sanity check, percentage upper bound, Korean case number year range) |
| `RegexRule` | interface | the 36 new regex rules all satisfy this |
| `StructuralDefinition` | interface | the output type of every new structural parser |
| `StructuralParser` | interface | the 5 new structural parsers all satisfy this |
| `Candidate` | interface | emitted by the regex phase (confidence 1.0) and the heuristic phase (< 1.0) |
| `HeuristicContext` | interface | passed to every new heuristic's `detect()` — contains `structuralDefinitions`, `priorCandidates`, `documentLanguage` |
| `Heuristic` | interface | the 4 new heuristics all satisfy this |

Verify these exports exist before writing any Phase 1 code:

```bash
grep -E '^export (type|interface) (Level|Language|Category|PostFilter|RegexRule|StructuralDefinition|StructuralParser|Candidate|HeuristicContext|Heuristic)\b' src/detection/_framework/types.ts | wc -l
# Expected: 10
```

If the count is not 10, Phase 0 is incomplete — do NOT continue with Phase 1.

### 6.2 Why nothing new goes in `types.ts`

The review (see session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md finding 2.1) confirmed that `HeuristicContext` is the only cross-phase context type the framework needs:

- **Regex rules are stateless.** No context parameter. The runner handles normalization + exec loop; the rule is pure data (`RegExp` + metadata).
- **Structural parsers run first.** Nothing upstream to consume, so no context parameter. They receive only the normalized text.
- **Heuristics run last.** They consume structural definitions + prior regex candidates + document language, all of which live in `HeuristicContext`.

Adding more interfaces would inflate the framework's surface area without adding expressiveness. **Phase 1 extends the runner and adds concrete rule files, but it does NOT extend the type vocabulary.** The types listed below intentionally live elsewhere:

| Type | Lives in | Why not `types.ts` |
|---|---|---|
| `RunAllResult`, `RunAllOptions`, `PhaseOptions` | `_framework/runner.ts` | Runner orchestration concern, not rule-shape concern. Phase 1 adds these as part of § 7. |
| `DetectAllResult`, `DetectAllInZipResult`, `DetectAllOptions`, `ScopedCandidate`, `ScopedStructuralDefinition` | `detect-all.ts` | Top-level detection API surface, not framework primitives. Phase 1 adds these in § 8. |
| `NonPiiCandidate` | `src/ui/engine.ts` | Engine-level aggregated shape (has `count` and `scopes` fields the framework does not know about). Phase 1 adds this in § 8.3. |
| `"ko" \| "en" \| "mixed"` (the DOCUMENT language union, distinct from rule-declared `Language`) | inlined in `HeuristicContext.documentLanguage` and in `runner.ts` as a local helper type | Two different unions for two different purposes (rule declaration vs document detection); merging them loses the `"universal"` vs `"mixed"` distinction. Do NOT add a named alias. |
| `Phase` enum (`"structural" \| "regex" \| "heuristics"`) | DO NOT ADD | Runner has three functions with distinct return types. A phase enum would be dead code that opens the door to switch-on-phase dispatch logic — precisely the anti-pattern RULES_GUIDE § 3.4 rejected. |

### 6.3 What you WILL add to `types.test.ts`

`_framework/types.test.ts` gets a small extension: three new type-level assertions that verify the shapes Phase 1's runner extensions depend on. These are compile-time guards — if a future refactor accidentally loosens a type, the test fails at build time.

Append this `describe` block at the bottom of `src/detection/_framework/types.test.ts` (do NOT modify any Phase 0 test above it):

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, expectTypeOf } from "vitest";

import type {
  Candidate,
  HeuristicContext,
  Language,
} from "./types.js";

describe("framework types — Phase 1 assertions", () => {
  it("HeuristicContext.documentLanguage is the detected-language union, not rule-language", () => {
    // detectLanguage returns "ko" | "en" | "mixed" — this must be the type of
    // HeuristicContext.documentLanguage. It is NOT `Language` ("ko" | "en" |
    // "universal") because "universal" is only valid as a rule declaration,
    // not as a detected document state.
    const ctx: HeuristicContext = {
      structuralDefinitions: [],
      priorCandidates: [],
      documentLanguage: "mixed",
    };
    expectTypeOf(ctx.documentLanguage).toEqualTypeOf<"ko" | "en" | "mixed">();
    // Compile-time rejection: "universal" must NOT be assignable.
    // @ts-expect-error — "universal" is not a valid documentLanguage value
    const bad: HeuristicContext["documentLanguage"] = "universal";
    void bad;
  });

  it("Language union is closed at three values", () => {
    // Typed exhaustiveness check. If someone adds "ja" or "zh" to Language
    // without updating the registry, this switch stops being exhaustive and
    // TypeScript fails at compile time.
    function narrow(l: Language): "ko" | "en" | "universal" {
      switch (l) {
        case "ko":
          return "ko";
        case "en":
          return "en";
        case "universal":
          return "universal";
      }
    }
    expect(narrow("ko")).toBe("ko");
    expect(narrow("en")).toBe("en");
    expect(narrow("universal")).toBe("universal");
  });

  it("Candidate is plain data (JSON round-trippable)", () => {
    // Guards against accidentally adding a method or getter to Candidate.
    // Candidate must remain JSON-serializable because engine.ts crosses the
    // UI state boundary (via Svelte $state) where proxies plus methods
    // misbehave in subtle ways.
    const c: Candidate = {
      text: "50,000,000원",
      ruleId: "financial.won-amount",
      confidence: 1.0,
    };
    const roundTripped = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(c));
    expect(roundTripped).toEqual(c);
    expect(Object.keys(roundTripped).sort()).toEqual([
      "confidence",
      "ruleId",
      "text",
    ]);
  });
});
```

These three tests total ~50 lines. Every other test in `types.test.ts` is UNCHANGED.

### 6.4 Verification step

After appending the three tests, verify:

```bash
bun run test src/detection/_framework/types.test.ts
```

Expected: all Phase 0 type tests still pass + the 3 new tests pass. Then verify that `types.ts` itself is untouched relative to Phase 0:

```bash
git diff 187b7f8 -- src/detection/_framework/types.ts
# Expected: empty (no changes)
```

If `git diff` shows any change to `types.ts`, revert it. Phase 1 MUST NOT modify that file.

---

## 7. Runner extensions (`_framework/runner.ts`)

Phase 0 delivers `runRegexPhase` — a single function that normalizes, level-filters, runs the exec loop, recovers original bytes, and returns a flat `Candidate[]`. Phase 1 extends this file with three new phase functions and one top-level orchestrator, plus an optional language-filter hook on the existing `runRegexPhase`.

**The exact new file state is below. Copy it verbatim.** Phase 0's `runRegexPhase` body is preserved line-for-line; the only change is the signature extension to accept an optional 4th parameter and the addition of a private helper that operates on a pre-normalized `PositionMap`.

### 7.1 Top-of-file JSDoc (replace Phase 0's module comment)

Replace the Phase 0 top comment with this block. The ASCII diagram mirrors § 4.1 of this brief with no deviation — update both places if you ever change either.

 *       RunAllResult { candidates, structuralDefinitions, documentLanguage }
 *
 * Key properties:
 *
 *   1. Normalization runs ONCE per call. All three phases share the same
 *      PositionMap. Parsers and heuristics that need original-byte recovery
 *      use the shared offset map — never re-normalize.
 *
 *   2. Structural phase runs first on purpose. Its output becomes
 *      HeuristicContext.structuralDefinitions so phase 3 can skip D9-defined
 *      labels (e.g., "the Buyer" when "the Buyer" means "ABC Corporation").
 *
 *   3. Regex phase is stateless. Same semantics as Phase 0 (clone regex per
 *      rule, exec loop, postFilter, slice original bytes via origOffsets).
 *
 *   4. Heuristic phase runs last. Consumes structural definitions + prior
 *      regex candidates + document language. Applies role blacklist internally
 *      (each heuristic imports its own blacklist; the runner stays blacklist-
 *      agnostic).
 *
 *   5. No dedup at runner level. The runner returns overlapping/duplicate
 *      candidates freely. Dedup happens in `buildAllTargetsFromZip` per
 *      RULES_GUIDE § 12.9 "no early dedupe".
 *
 *   6. FAIL-LOUD at every step. No try/catch anywhere in this file. A
 *      throwing rule / parser / heuristic surfaces as a stack trace per
 *      design-v1 Lock-in #15 (zero-miss invariant). Callers that want
 *      best-effort semantics must wrap the call themselves — the runner
 *      NEVER swallows.
 *
 *   7. Language filter is optional per-call. When `opts.language` is
 *      undefined, every rule runs regardless of its `languages` field
 *      (Phase 0 backward compatibility — this is the code path legacy
 *      `detect-pii.ts` uses). When set to "ko" | "en" | "mixed", rules whose
 *      `languages` excludes the filter value AND does not include "universal"
 *      are skipped. Per RULES_GUIDE § 11.2, "mixed" passes through every
 *      rule (bilingual documents run both language tracks).
 *
 * See:
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 3.4 (three-shape rationale)
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 10.3 (level filter)
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 11.2 (language filter)
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 4.1 (this diagram, authoritative copy)
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 7 (this section, the exact spec)
 */
```

### 7.2 Module imports

Replace Phase 0's import block with:

```typescript
import { normalizeForMatching, type PositionMap } from "../normalize.js";

import { detectLanguage } from "./language-detect.js";
import {
  ALL_HEURISTICS,
  ALL_REGEX_RULES,
  ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS,
} from "./registry.js";
import type {
  Candidate,
  Heuristic,
  HeuristicContext,
  Language,
  Level,
  RegexRule,
  StructuralDefinition,
  StructuralParser,
} from "./types.js";
```

**Note on the registry import:** `ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS` and `ALL_HEURISTICS` do not exist in Phase 0's `registry.ts`. You MUST add them (initially as empty arrays) as part of the same commit that extends `runner.ts`. See § 7.9 for the exact diff on `registry.ts`. Without that extension, this import fails at module load.

### 7.3 Module-local option and helper types

Add these private (unexported) declarations right after the imports. They are not promoted to `types.ts` because they are runner-internal — see § 6.2 for why.

```typescript
/**
 * Options passed through every phase function. Kept minimal on purpose:
 * the runner orchestrates, it does not feature-config.
 *
 * NOT exported. Callers interact with the runner through `RunAllOptions`
 * (exported below), which is a superset of these fields.
 */
interface PhaseOptions {
  /**
   * Document language for rule filtering. When `undefined`, no filter is
   * applied (all rules run — Phase 0 backward compat). When set, rules whose
   * `languages` array does not include this value AND does not include
   * "universal" are skipped. When set to "mixed", every rule passes.
   *
   * The distinction between `Language` ("ko" | "en" | "universal") and this
   * field's type ("ko" | "en" | "mixed") is deliberate: "universal" is a
   * rule-declaration value meaning "applies to any document", while "mixed"
   * is a detection outcome meaning "document has both languages". They are
   * two different concepts in two different coordinate systems.
   */
  readonly language?: "ko" | "en" | "mixed";
}
```

### 7.4 Language filter helper

```typescript

function shouldRunForLanguage(
  ruleLanguages: readonly Language[],

  if (filter === undefined) return true;

### 7.5 `runRegexPhase` — extended signature, Phase 0 body preserved

The public signature grows a fourth optional parameter. The body is unchanged structurally — the level filter gains an AND-clause for language, and the body is extracted into a private helper so `runAllPhases` can skip re-normalization.

```typescript
/**
 * Run every RegexRule that matches the given level (and optional language),
 * returning candidates with original-byte recovery via `normalizeForMatching`'s
 * offset map.
 *
 * Phase 0 contract preserved: calling without `opts` — i.e., the legacy
 * `runRegexPhase(text, level, rules)` three-arg form — applies level filter
 * only, matching the exact Phase 0 semantics byte-for-byte. This is the code
 * path that `detect-pii.ts` legacy shim uses, so its output MUST NOT change
 * as a result of Phase 1 extensions. The Phase 0 characterization tests
 * (T1–T18) verify this invariant.
 *
 * Does NOT deduplicate. Callers run dedup on the combined output of all phases
 * (see `buildAllTargetsFromZip` in detect-all.ts).
 */
export function runRegexPhase(
  text: string,
  level: Level,
  rules: readonly RegexRule[],
  opts: PhaseOptions = {},
): Candidate[] {
  if (text.length === 0) return [];
  const map = normalizeForMatching(text);
  if (map.text.length === 0) return [];
  return runRegexPhaseOnMap(text, map, level, rules, opts);
}

/**
 * Same as `runRegexPhase` but operates on a pre-computed PositionMap. Used by
 * `runAllPhases` to avoid re-normalizing the text between phases (normalize
 * is O(n) and non-trivial on 50KB-scale contract scopes). Not exported —
 * external callers should use `runRegexPhase`.
 */
function runRegexPhaseOnMap(
  originalText: string,
  map: PositionMap,
  level: Level,
  rules: readonly RegexRule[],
  opts: PhaseOptions,
): Candidate[] {
  // Compose level filter with language filter. When `opts.language` is
  // undefined, `shouldRunForLanguage` returns true for every rule — so this
  // reduces to Phase 0's `r.levels.includes(level)` expression exactly.
  const active = rules.filter(
    (r) =>
      r.levels.includes(level) &&
      shouldRunForLanguage(r.languages, opts.language),
  );

  const out: Candidate[] = [];

  for (const rule of active) {
    // Clone per rule to avoid lastIndex state pollution across calls and runs.
    // Cost is negligible (one compile per rule per scope) and the safety is
    // essential — see Phase 0 § 9 for the rationale.
    const re = new RegExp(rule.pattern.source, rule.pattern.flags);
    let m: RegExpExecArray | null;
    while ((m = re.exec(map.text)) !== null) {
      const normalized = m[0];
      if (rule.postFilter && !rule.postFilter(normalized)) continue;

      const startNorm = m.index;
      const endNorm = startNorm + normalized.length;
      // origOffsets has length map.text.length + 1 (sentinel), so endNorm
      // (which can equal map.text.length) is always in range.
      const startOrig = map.origOffsets[startNorm]!;
      const endOrig = map.origOffsets[endNorm]!;
      const original = originalText.slice(startOrig, endOrig);

      out.push({
        text: original,
        ruleId: rule.id,
        confidence: 1.0,
      });
    }
  }

  return out;
}
```

**Phase 0 preservation proof.** When `opts.language === undefined`, `shouldRunForLanguage(r.languages, undefined)` returns `true` unconditionally (first branch of the helper). The filter expression reduces to `r.levels.includes(level)` — the exact Phase 0 expression. The 18 characterization tests in `detect-pii.characterization.test.ts` continue to pass byte-for-byte after this change, because `detect-pii.ts`'s shim calls `runRegexPhase(text, "standard", IDENTIFIERS)` (three args, no opts).

### 7.6 `runStructuralPhase` — new

```typescript
/**
 * Run every StructuralParser in registry order, collecting their output into
 * a single flat `readonly StructuralDefinition[]`. Parser order matters for
 * downstream heuristics: later parsers can emit definitions that shadow
 * earlier ones. The runner does NOT apply shadow/merge semantics — it
 * concatenates in parser order and lets heuristics (or the UI) decide.
 *
 * Parsers receive the NORMALIZED text (same text the regex phase sees). If a
 * parser needs to recover original bytes for its `label` or `referent`, it
 * imports `normalizeForMatching` itself and re-runs it. Sharing the offset
 * map across phases would require passing a PositionMap parameter to every
 * parser signature — a bigger surface-area change than the one-line re-normal
 * each parser does once per call. (Normalize is idempotent and cheap on
 * already-normalized text.)
 *
 * STRUCTURAL PARSERS HAVE NO LEVEL FILTER. Structural parsing is either
 * useful or not; there is no "paranoid structural parsing". Only regex rules
 * and heuristics are tier-gated. See RULES_GUIDE § 10.2.
 *
 * FAIL-LOUD: a throwing parser bubbles up. The runner does NOT catch.
 */
export function runStructuralPhase(
  text: string,
  parsers: readonly StructuralParser[],
  opts: PhaseOptions = {},
): readonly StructuralDefinition[] {
  if (text.length === 0) return [];
  const map = normalizeForMatching(text);

    const produced = parser.parse(map.text);
    for (const def of produced) {
      out.push(def);
    }
  }

  return out;
}
```

### 7.7 `runHeuristicPhase` — new

```typescript
/**
 * Run every Heuristic that matches the given level (and optional language),
 * threading the provided `HeuristicContext` (which bundles prior structural
 * definitions + prior regex candidates + document language) into each
 * `detect()` call. Returns a flat `Candidate[]` with confidence < 1.0, same
 * shape as the regex phase output.
 *
 * Heuristics are REQUIRED (per RULES_GUIDE § 6.2) to:
 *
 *   1. Consume `context.structuralDefinitions` — skip labels that are already
 *      defined as a structural "the Buyer → ABC Corporation" binding (D9
 *      invariant).
 *   2. Consume `context.priorCandidates` — avoid double-emitting candidates
 *      already found by a higher-confidence regex rule.
 *   3. Consult a role blacklist (imported as a module constant by each
 *      heuristic individually — NOT threaded through this runner).
 *   4. Apply internal confidence calibration (typically 0.5–0.9).
 *
 * The runner does NOT enforce these. Each heuristic's own tests do — see
 * § 14 of this brief for the heuristic-level test spec.
 *
 * FAIL-LOUD: a throwing heuristic bubbles up. A heuristic that wants to
 * gracefully skip on malformed input MUST return an empty array explicitly.
 *
 * Original-byte recovery is the HEURISTIC's responsibility, not the runner's.
 * Unlike the regex phase (where every candidate corresponds to a single
 * `RegExp.exec` match and byte recovery is mechanical), heuristic spans can
 * come from joins, frequency counts, or context windows — there is no
 * universal recovery rule. Each heuristic in § 14 imports a shared helper
 * `recoverOriginalSlice(originalText, map, startNorm, endNorm)` from
 * `_framework/recover-bytes.ts` (which Phase 1 adds as a 6-line utility in
 * the § 14 TDD step). The runner does not call this helper itself.

### 7.8 `runAllPhases` — top-level orchestrator

```typescript
/**
 * Result of a full three-phase detection run on a single text blob.
 *

 *
 *   - `candidates` contains the UNION of phase-2 (regex) and phase-3
 *     (heuristic) outputs in phase order: regex first, then heuristics. No
 *     dedup. Dedup is the caller's responsibility (see
 *     `buildAllTargetsFromZip` in detect-all.ts).
 *
 *   - `structuralDefinitions` is the phase-1 output, exposed as a side
 *     channel for callers (such as engine.ts) that want to render the
 *     structural tree in the UI without re-running phase 1.
 *
 *   - `documentLanguage` is the detected language at the time of this call.

### 7.9 `registry.ts` extension (same commit)

The `import { ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS, ALL_HEURISTICS } from "./registry.js"` at the top of `runner.ts` requires those exports to exist. Add them to `src/detection/_framework/registry.ts` in the same commit as the runner extension.

**Diff on `registry.ts`:**

```typescript
// Before (Phase 0 state):
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
import type { RegexRule } from "./types.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
] as const;

// After (Phase 1 runner-extension commit):
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
// NOTE: structural/heuristics subdirectories do not yet contain parser/
// heuristic implementations at the time this diff lands. Their index.ts files
// export empty arrays. § 12 and § 14 of this brief populate them across
// subsequent TDD steps.
import { ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS as _STRUCTURAL } from "../rules/structural/index.js";
import { ALL_HEURISTICS as _HEURISTICS } from "../rules/heuristics/index.js";
import type {
  Heuristic,
  RegexRule,
  StructuralParser,
} from "./types.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...FINANCIAL (§ 9)
  //   ...TEMPORAL  (§ 10)
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;

export const ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS: readonly StructuralParser[] = _STRUCTURAL;

export const ALL_HEURISTICS: readonly Heuristic[] = _HEURISTICS;
```

**Scaffolding the subdirectory `index.ts` files.** In the same commit, create two tiny stub files that export empty arrays:

```typescript
// src/detection/rules/structural/index.ts — initial state (populated in § 12)
import type { StructuralParser } from "../../_framework/types.js";

export const ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS: readonly StructuralParser[] = [] as const;
```

```typescript
// src/detection/rules/heuristics/index.ts — initial state (populated in § 14)
import type { Heuristic } from "../../_framework/types.js";

export const ALL_HEURISTICS: readonly Heuristic[] = [] as const;
```

The empty-array scaffolding lets `runner.ts` import the registry without waiting for § 12 / § 14 work. The runner test suite (§ 7.11) uses mock parsers/heuristics passed via `opts`, so it does NOT depend on the registry being populated.

**Verify registry still load-time checks.** The Phase 0 `verifyRegistry()` function only iterates `ALL_REGEX_RULES` to check `g` flag, unique ids, etc. Phase 1 leaves that function unchanged. A later hygiene phase may add parser/heuristic verification; for Phase 1, the per-parser and per-heuristic tests catch malformed entries individually.

### 7.10 Complete extended runner.ts (assembly order)

The final file layout for `src/detection/_framework/runner.ts` is:

1. Top-of-file JSDoc block (§ 7.1)
2. Module imports (§ 7.2)
3. `PhaseOptions` interface (§ 7.3)
4. `shouldRunForLanguage` helper (§ 7.4)
5. `runRegexPhase` public + `runRegexPhaseOnMap` private (§ 7.5)
6. `runStructuralPhase` public + `runStructuralPhaseOnMap` private (§ 7.6)
7. `runHeuristicPhase` public + `runHeuristicPhaseOnMap` private (§ 7.7)
8. `RunAllResult` interface (§ 7.8)
9. `RunAllOptions` interface (§ 7.8)
10. `runAllPhases` public (§ 7.8)

Total lines including JSDoc: approximately 320. The Phase 0 baseline was approximately 70 lines. Phase 1 adds approximately 250 lines to this file.

### 7.11 Runner test additions (`runner.test.ts`)

Append the following `describe` groups to `src/detection/_framework/runner.test.ts`. Phase 0's existing tests (approximately 15 tests across 2 describe blocks) are UNTOUCHED.

**Test group A — `runRegexPhase` language filter (12 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| A1 | `runRegexPhase(text, "standard", rules)` three-arg form (no opts) runs every rule regardless of language (Phase 0 compat proof) |
| A2 | `{ language: "ko" }` skips rules whose languages is `["en"]` |
| A3 | `{ language: "ko" }` includes rules whose languages is `["universal"]` |
| A4 | `{ language: "ko" }` includes rules whose languages is `["ko"]` |
| A5 | `{ language: "en" }` skips `["ko"]`-only rules |
| A6 | `{ language: "en" }` includes `["universal"]`-only rules |
| A7 | `{ language: "mixed" }` runs every rule regardless of language |
| A8 | `{ language: undefined }` explicit behaves identical to omitted opts |
| A9 | A rule with `languages: ["ko", "en"]` runs under both `"ko"` and `"en"` filters |
| A10 | Level filter and language filter compose with AND (rule must pass BOTH) |
| A11 | Empty `rules` array returns `[]` regardless of filters |
| A12 | Phase 0 compat: the 8 `IDENTIFIERS` rules all fire on a Phase 0 smoke input when called via the three-arg form |

**Test group B — `runStructuralPhase` (10 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| B1 | Empty `parsers` array returns empty `readonly StructuralDefinition[]` |
| B2 | Single parser emitting 3 definitions passes them through unchanged |
| B3 | Two parsers' output concatenated in parser-array order |
| B4 | Language filter `"ko"` skips English-only parser |
| B5 | Language filter `"en"` skips Korean-only parser |
| B6 | Parser with `languages: ["universal"]` runs under any filter |
| B7 | Language filter `"mixed"` runs every parser |
| B8 | Parser that throws bubbles up (fail-loud) — `expect(() => runStructuralPhase(...)).toThrow()` |
| B9 | Parser receives NORMALIZED text (use fullwidth input that `normalizeForMatching` folds) |
| B10 | Empty input text returns `[]` without calling any parser |

**Test group C — `runHeuristicPhase` (12 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| C1 | Empty `heuristics` array returns `[]` |
| C2 | Single heuristic's output passes through unchanged |
| C3 | `context.structuralDefinitions` reachable from inside the heuristic (mock heuristic returns `ctx.structuralDefinitions.length` encoded in candidate.text) |
| C4 | `context.priorCandidates` reachable likewise |
| C5 | `context.documentLanguage` reachable likewise |
| C6 | Level filter applied (heuristic with `levels: ["paranoid"]` does NOT run at `"standard"`) |
| C7 | Language filter applied |
| C8 | A throwing heuristic bubbles up |
| C9 | Two heuristics' output concatenated in heuristic-array order |
| C10 | Heuristic confidence values preserved in output (0.75, 0.6, etc. — no rounding) |
| C11 | Empty input text returns `[]` without calling any heuristic |
| C12 | Heuristic returning `[]` is valid (empty-output is not an error) |

**Test group D — `runAllPhases` integration (9 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| D1 | Empty text → `{ candidates: [], structuralDefinitions: [], documentLanguage: "en" }` |
| D2 | Text with only regex matches → `candidates` has those; `structuralDefinitions` empty |
| D3 | Text with only structural matches → `structuralDefinitions` populated; `candidates` empty |
| D4 | Text exercising all three phases → union of regex + heur in `candidates`; structural side-channel populated |
| D5 | Regex candidates appear BEFORE heuristic candidates in `candidates` (phase order assertion) |
| D6 | `detectLanguage` is called when `opts.language` is undefined; explicit `opts.language` overrides when set (test with an English text forced to `"ko"` and assert Korean-only rules fire) |
| D7 | `HeuristicContext` passed to phase 3 contains the EXACT arrays from phases 1 and 2 (identity check via a mock heuristic that captures the context reference) |
| D8 | Fail-loud propagation — a mock parser set to throw causes the whole `runAllPhases` call to throw |
| D9 | `opts.rules`, `opts.parsers`, `opts.heuristics` override registry defaults (assert by passing empty arrays and observing empty output) |

**Test group E — perf smoke (1 optional test):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| E1 | `runAllPhases` on a 100KB pathological input returns within 1000ms (soft budget; overlaps with `redos-guard.test.ts` but catches full-pipeline regressions) |

**Total new tests in `runner.test.ts`:** 44 tests (12 + 10 + 12 + 9 + 1). Phase 0 baseline was ~15 tests in this file, so post-Phase-1 count is ~59.

### 7.12 Acceptance checklist for the runner extension

Before committing the runner extension, verify every item:

- [ ] `runner.ts` exports exactly: `runRegexPhase`, `runStructuralPhase`, `runHeuristicPhase`, `runAllPhases`, `RunAllResult`, `RunAllOptions` (6 public exports)
- [ ] `PhaseOptions` interface is NOT exported (it is module-local)
- [ ] `shouldRunForLanguage` helper is NOT exported
- [ ] `runRegexPhaseOnMap`, `runStructuralPhaseOnMap`, `runHeuristicPhaseOnMap` are NOT exported (module-local helpers)
- [ ] `runRegexPhase` signature accepts optional 4th parameter `opts: PhaseOptions`
- [ ] `runRegexPhase(text, level, rules)` three-arg form still compiles and behaves identically to Phase 0
- [ ] Phase 0 characterization tests still pass byte-for-byte (`bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.characterization.test.ts`)
- [ ] Phase 0 runner tests still pass (`bun run test src/detection/_framework/runner.test.ts` — original describe blocks)
- [ ] 44 new runner tests pass
- [ ] `types.ts` has zero new exports relative to commit `187b7f8` (`git diff 187b7f8 -- src/detection/_framework/types.ts` is empty)
- [ ] `registry.ts` exports `ALL_STRUCTURAL_PARSERS` and `ALL_HEURISTICS` (may initially be empty arrays, populated in § 12 and § 14)
- [ ] `src/detection/rules/structural/index.ts` and `src/detection/rules/heuristics/index.ts` exist with empty-array scaffolding
- [ ] No `try` keyword appears in `runner.ts` (`grep -n '\btry\b' src/detection/_framework/runner.ts` returns nothing)
- [ ] The ASCII diagram in the top-of-file comment matches § 4.1 of this brief
- [ ] `shouldRunForLanguage` behavior matches RULES_GUIDE § 11.2 (verified by tests A2–A9)
- [ ] Normalize-once invariant holds: only `runAllPhases` and the three public entry points call `normalizeForMatching` — the three internal `...OnMap` helpers never do (`grep -c normalizeForMatching src/detection/_framework/runner.ts` returns 4: one import + three public-wrapper call sites)

## 8. `detect-all.ts` — new top-level pipeline

`src/detection/detect-all.ts` is the new top-level detection API. It mirrors the shape of legacy `detect-pii.ts` — three functions: pure-text, zip-walker, target-builder — but delegates to `runAllPhases` underneath. Legacy `detect-pii.ts` stays untouched. This is the strangler-fig parallel the review locked in as decision 1.1A.

### 8.1 Public surface (exact exports)

`src/detection/detect-all.ts` exports exactly the following, in this order:

```typescript
// Interfaces
export interface DetectAllResult { ... }
export interface ScopedCandidate { ... }
export interface ScopedStructuralDefinition { ... }
export interface DetectAllInZipResult { ... }
export interface DetectAllOptions { ... }

// Functions
export function detectAll(text: string, opts?: DetectAllOptions): DetectAllResult;
export function detectAllInZip(zip: JSZip, opts?: DetectAllOptions): Promise<DetectAllInZipResult>;
export function buildAllTargetsFromZip(zip: JSZip, opts?: DetectAllOptions): Promise<readonly string[]>;
```

**Nothing else.** In particular, `NonPiiCandidate` (the UI-level aggregated shape) is NOT exported from here — it lives in `src/ui/engine.ts` because it has `count` and `scopes` fields that the framework does not produce. See § 8.3 for the engine migration contract.

### 8.2 Complete file content

Put this EXACTLY into `src/detection/detect-all.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Top-level detection API — Phase 1 replacement for `detect-pii.ts`.
 *
 * Three public entry points mirroring the legacy `detect-pii` shape:
 *
 *   1. `detectAll(text, opts?)` — pure function, takes plain text, runs all
 *      three phases (structural → regex → heuristic) via `runAllPhases`, and
 *      returns the combined candidates + structural side-channel + detected
 *      document language.
 *
 *   2. `detectAllInZip(zip, opts?)` — async, walks every text-bearing scope
 *      via `extractTextFromZip`, runs `detectAll` on each, and returns the
 *      candidates + structural definitions with their source scope attached.
 *
 *   3. `buildAllTargetsFromZip(zip, opts?)` — async, returns a deduped,
 *      longest-first sorted array of literal strings ready to feed into
 *      `redactDocx({ targets })`. Mirrors legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` from
 *      `detect-pii.ts` so the engine.ts migration is a one-line swap.
 *
 * STRANGLER-FIG NOTE: this file runs IN PARALLEL with `detect-pii.ts`. The
 * legacy shim is untouched. The only caller that migrates to detect-all is
 * `src/ui/engine.ts`, in the final commit of Phase 1. Every other caller
 * (including all Phase 0 characterization tests) continues to use detect-pii.
 * This preserves the Phase 0 ship gate byte-for-byte.
 *
 * FAIL-LOUD: no try/catch anywhere in this file. A throwing rule, parser, or
 * heuristic bubbles up as a stack trace. See phase-1-rulebook.md § 3
 * invariant 16 for rationale.
 *
 * See:
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 8 (this spec, authoritative)
 *   - src/detection/_framework/runner.ts (`runAllPhases`, the core)
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 9 (dedup semantics)

### 8.3 `engine.ts` `Analysis` shape extension contract

The final TDD step of Phase 1 (see § 16) migrates `src/ui/engine.ts` from legacy `detect-pii` to `detect-all`. The migration is fully specified here so that step is mechanical.

**Before (Phase 0 state, `src/ui/engine.ts`):**

```typescript
import { detectPiiInZip, type DetectedMatch } from "../detection/detect-pii.js";

export interface PiiCandidate {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly kind: DetectedMatch["kind"];
  readonly count: number;
  readonly scopes: ReadonlyArray<Scope>;
}

export interface Analysis {
  readonly entityGroups: ReadonlyArray<VariantGroup>;
  readonly piiCandidates: ReadonlyArray<PiiCandidate>;
  readonly fileStats: FileStats;
}
```

**After (Phase 1 final commit):**

```typescript
import {
  detectAllInZip,
  type ScopedCandidate,
  type ScopedStructuralDefinition,
} from "../detection/detect-all.js";
// Legacy import retained as type-only so that the `PiiCandidate.kind` field
// (which is still `DetectedMatch["kind"]`) continues to compile. The value
// `detectPiiInZip` is no longer called in the production code path — engine
// now goes through detect-all. Tests that directly compare against detect-pii
// still import it from its own module.
import type { DetectedMatch } from "../detection/detect-pii.js";

/** PII candidate — preserved shape so UI / tests / state.svelte.ts keep compiling. */
export interface PiiCandidate {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly kind: DetectedMatch["kind"];
  readonly count: number;
  readonly scopes: ReadonlyArray<Scope>;
}

/**
 * NEW: non-PII candidate from the Phase 1 rulebook (financial, temporal,
 * entities, structural, legal, heuristics). Emitted alongside piiCandidates
 * so the UI can render a richer redaction suggestion tree.
 *
 * `category` is derived from the dotted `ruleId` prefix (e.g.
 * `"financial.won-amount"` → `"financial"`). `confidence` is pass-through
 * from the underlying `Candidate` — 1.0 for regex candidates, < 1.0 for
 * heuristic candidates.
 *
 * The UI redesign brief (see session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md finding 1.3) will
 * group these by category and offer per-group add/remove affordances. Until
 * then, `CandidatesPanel.svelte` does not render `nonPiiCandidates`, but
 * `defaultSelections(analysis)` DOES include their text in the returned
 * `Set<string>` — so applying redaction DOES scrub them even in the
 * pre-redesign UI.
 */
export interface NonPiiCandidate {
  readonly text: string;
  readonly ruleId: string;
  readonly category:
    | "financial"
    | "temporal"
    | "entities"
    | "structural"
    | "legal"
    | "heuristics";
  readonly confidence: number;
  readonly count: number;
  readonly scopes: ReadonlyArray<Scope>;
}

export interface Analysis {
  readonly entityGroups: ReadonlyArray<VariantGroup>;
  readonly piiCandidates: ReadonlyArray<PiiCandidate>;
  /**
   * NEW: Phase 1 rulebook output. Ordered longest-first by text length so
   * the panel's default scan order matches the redactor's greedy alternation.
   */
  readonly nonPiiCandidates: ReadonlyArray<NonPiiCandidate>;
  readonly fileStats: FileStats;
}
```

### 8.4 Migration rules for `engine.ts`

The `aggregatePii` helper at `src/ui/engine.ts:178-205` is replaced by a single `aggregateAll` helper that:

1. Calls `detectAllInZip(zip)` ONCE per `analyzeZip` call (not `detectPiiInZip`). Note the call is `await detectAllInZip(zip)` with default options — level `"standard"`, auto-detect language.

2. Partitions the resulting `candidates` array by `ruleId` prefix:
   - `ruleId.startsWith("identifiers.")` → route to `piiCandidates` (kind-mapped via inverse of the `KIND_TO_SUBCATEGORY` table from `src/detection/patterns.ts`; see § 8.1 of the Phase 0 brief for the forward mapping).
   - Everything else → route to `nonPiiCandidates`, keeping the raw `ruleId` and deriving `category` from `ruleId.split(".")[0]`.

3. Within each partition, dedupe by `text` and count occurrences per scope. Dedup semantics match Phase 0 `aggregatePii`: Map keyed on `candidate.text`, `count++` per occurrence, `scopes` is a deduped list of scopes by `.path`.

4. Structural definitions from `detectAllInZip` contribute to `nonPiiCandidates` with `category: "structural"`, `confidence: 1.0`, `text: definition.referent`. The label is NOT added — per § 8.2 `buildAllTargetsFromZip` rationale, labels are D9-protected.

**Behavior contract (invariants for the migration):**

- `piiCandidates.length` after Phase 1 is EQUAL to `piiCandidates.length` before Phase 1 on the same input. The identifier rules are unchanged; the partition is lossless. A new `engine.test.ts` test asserts this directly against the worst-case fixture.

- `nonPiiCandidates` may be empty on pure-identifier inputs. (E.g., a test fixture containing only one email address produces one `piiCandidates` entry and zero `nonPiiCandidates` entries.)

- `defaultSelections(analysis)` includes every entry from `piiCandidates.text` AND `nonPiiCandidates.text` AND `entityGroups[*].literals[*].text`. The returned `Set<string>` grows relative to Phase 0, but no existing entry is removed. Existing tests that assert specific literals are present keep passing; tests that assert specific literals are ABSENT may need to relax their assertions if the literal happens to now be picked up by a Phase 1 rule.

- The `applyRedaction` code path is UNCHANGED. It continues to take `selections: ReadonlySet<string>` and pass `[...selections]` to `finalizeRedaction`. The growth in the selection set is transparent to the finalize layer.

- `listScopes(zip).length` still populates `fileStats.scopeCount`. The migration does not touch `fileStats`.

### 8.5 One new `engine.test.ts` test

Append to the existing `describe("analyzeZip", …)` block (do NOT modify any existing test above it):

```typescript
it("populates nonPiiCandidates for Phase 1 matches on the worst-case fixture", async () => {
  const bytes = await loadFixture("bilingual_nda_worst_case.docx");
  const analysis = await analyzeZip(bytes, ["ABC Corporation"]);

  // The bilingual NDA fixture contains at least one KRW amount
  // ("50,000,000원") and at least one Korean date ("2024년 3월 15일"). Both
  // should appear in nonPiiCandidates under the financial / temporal
  // categories respectively.
  expect(analysis.nonPiiCandidates.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

  const categoriesSeen = new Set(
    analysis.nonPiiCandidates.map((c) => c.category),
  );
  // At least one of financial or temporal must fire on this fixture.
  expect(
    categoriesSeen.has("financial") || categoriesSeen.has("temporal"),
  ).toBe(true);

  // Backward-compat invariant: piiCandidates does not regress on the same
  // input. The fixture is known to contain at least one email-shaped literal.
  expect(analysis.piiCandidates.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1);

  // defaultSelections must include every new nonPiiCandidate's text.
  const selections = defaultSelections(analysis);
  for (const cand of analysis.nonPiiCandidates) {
    expect(selections.has(cand.text)).toBe(true);
  }
});
```

No other existing test in `engine.test.ts` is modified. All 17 Phase 0 tests continue to pass unchanged.

### 8.6 `detect-all.test.ts` — new behavioral test file

Create `src/detection/detect-all.test.ts`. The following test-group table specifies shape and count; exact test bodies are written during TDD step 4 of § 16. Phase 1 targets ~50 tests in this file.

**Group 1 — `detectAll` unit tests (20 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| 1 | Empty text returns `{ candidates: [], structuralDefinitions: [], documentLanguage: "en" }` |
| 2 | Whitespace-only text returns empty result with documentLanguage `"en"` |
| 3 | Single Korean RRN input produces one candidate with `ruleId: "identifiers.korean-rrn"` |
| 4 | Single English email input produces one candidate with `ruleId: "identifiers.email"` |
| 5 | Text containing an identifier and a financial match produces two candidates |
| 6 | Regex candidates appear before heuristic candidates in output (phase-order assertion) |
| 7 | `opts.level: "conservative"` filters out `"paranoid"`-only rules (use a synthetic test rule registered with `["paranoid"]` via `runAllPhases` rules override — but detectAll doesn't expose that; instead test via a real `"paranoid"`-only rule in the registry once § 9–14 land, or skip until then and add to `runner.test.ts`) |
| 8 | `opts.language: "ko"` on an English-only input excludes English-only rule output |
| 9 | `opts.language: "en"` on a Korean-only input excludes Korean-only rule output |
| 10 | `opts.language: "mixed"` runs every rule regardless of input language |
| 11 | `documentLanguage` reflects the input — Korean-only text returns `"ko"` |
| 12 | `documentLanguage` reflects the input — English-only text returns `"en"` |
| 13 | `documentLanguage` reflects the input — 50/50 bilingual returns `"mixed"` |
| 14 | Explicit `opts.language` override wins over auto-detect |
| 15 | `structuralDefinitions` is populated on an input containing a "by and between ABC Corp" party declaration (once § 12 lands) |
| 16 | Heuristic confidence < 1.0 is preserved end-to-end |
| 17 | Regex confidence is exactly 1.0 |
| 18 | Candidates preserve original bytes (fullwidth digits input → fullwidth-digit candidate text, not halfwidth) |
| 19 | 50KB input returns within 1 second (soft perf budget) |
| 20 | Normalize is called ONCE per detectAll call (mock via spy on `normalizeForMatching` — optional; requires `vi.spyOn` setup) |

**Group 2 — `detectAllInZip` unit tests (15 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| 1 | Empty zip returns empty `{ candidates: [], structuralDefinitions: [] }` |
| 2 | Body-only zip walks the body scope |
| 3 | Header + footer + footnote zip walks all four scope kinds |
| 4 | Per-scope language detection: body in Korean, header in English, each scope runs its own detection (assert via ruleId presence) |
| 5 | Scope attribution is correct: a match found in `footnotes1` has `scope.path === "word/footnotes.xml"` |
| 6 | Walk order matches `extractTextFromZip` (body before footnotes before headers) |
| 7 | Duplicate matches across scopes appear twice in the output (no dedup at this level) |
| 8 | `opts.level: "conservative"` passes through to each scope's detectAll call |
| 9 | `opts.language` override passes through to each scope's detectAll call |
| 10 | Structural definitions found in one scope appear in the output with that scope attached |
| 11 | Structural definitions from the body do NOT leak into the heuristic context of a footnote scope (each scope is an independent runAllPhases call) |
| 12 | Empty scope (`<w:p/>` only) contributes no candidates |
| 13 | Fail-loud: a throwing rule bubbles up through detectAllInZip as a rejected promise |
| 14 | The returned arrays are plain `readonly` arrays, not iterators |
| 15 | `fileStats` is not exposed by `detectAllInZip` (belongs to engine.ts, not detection layer) |

**Group 3 — `buildAllTargetsFromZip` integration (10 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| 1 | Returns longest-first sorted |
| 2 | Dedupes across scopes (same email in body and footer collapses to one target) |
| 3 | Structural referents included |
| 4 | Structural labels NOT included (D9 guard) |
| 5 | Heuristic-emitted candidates included by default (confidence filter is engine.ts's job, not builder's) |
| 6 | `opts.level: "paranoid"` produces a superset of `"standard"` targets on a contract-shaped fixture |
| 7 | `opts.level: "conservative"` produces a subset of `"standard"` targets |
| 8 | Empty zip → empty array |
| 9 | Zip with only one scope containing one email → one-element array |
| 10 | Empty structural `referent` fields are skipped (no empty-string entries in output) |

**Group 4 — Phase 0 parity sanity checks (5 tests):**

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| 1 | On a pure-identifier input (e.g., one email), `buildAllTargetsFromZip` returns the same set as legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` — proves the strangler-fig no-behavior-change invariant for the identifiers subset |
| 2 | On the bilingual worst-case fixture, every legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` target appears in `buildAllTargetsFromZip` output (new pipeline is a superset) |
| 3 | `detectAll` and `detectPii` produce overlapping `identifier.*` candidates on the same input (every `detectPii` match has a corresponding `detectAll` candidate) |
| 4 | Legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` is NOT called from `detect-all.ts` (grep test — `grep buildTargetsFromZip src/detection/detect-all.ts` returns nothing) |
| 5 | Legacy `detectPii` is NOT called from `detect-all.ts` (grep test — same as above) |

**Total new tests in `detect-all.test.ts`:** 50 tests.

### 8.7 `detect-all.integration.test.ts` — new integration file

Create `src/detection/detect-all.integration.test.ts`. Runs against the existing `tests/fixtures/bilingual_nda_worst_case.docx` fixture (DO NOT modify the fixture). Target ~10 tests:

| # | Assertion |
|---|---|
| 1 | `detectAllInZip(fixtureZip).candidates.length` ≥ N, where N is the baseline captured on first run and frozen as a golden number |
| 2 | Every scope from `listScopes(fixtureZip)` is represented in the output OR explicitly documented as empty-of-matches in a comment |
| 3 | Structural definitions found on the fixture include at least one party declaration (the fixture has a "by and between" clause) |
| 4 | Financial candidates include at least one KRW amount (the fixture has "50,000,000원") |
| 5 | Temporal candidates include at least one Korean date (the fixture has "2024년") |
| 6 | `buildAllTargetsFromZip` output on the fixture is a SUPERSET of legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` output — every legacy target is present, new targets may be added |
| 7 | Perf: `buildAllTargetsFromZip(fixtureZip)` completes in under 2000 ms (soft budget — fails the test if exceeded but does not block CI on first-run spikes) |
| 8 | No duplicate targets in the output (Set invariant — use `new Set(result).size === result.length`) |
| 9 | Longest-first ordering holds over the full target list |
| 10 | `documentLanguage` detected on the fixture is `"mixed"` |

These tests double as the ship gate for Phase 1 integration. If any fails, the new pipeline is not yet ready for the engine.ts migration TDD step.

### 8.8 Acceptance checklist for `detect-all.ts`

- [ ] `detect-all.ts` exports exactly: `detectAll`, `detectAllInZip`, `buildAllTargetsFromZip`, `DetectAllResult`, `DetectAllInZipResult`, `DetectAllOptions`, `ScopedCandidate`, `ScopedStructuralDefinition` (8 public exports — no more, no less)
- [ ] `NonPiiCandidate` is NOT exported from `detect-all.ts` (it lives in `src/ui/engine.ts`)
- [ ] `detect-pii.ts` is unchanged (`git diff 187b7f8 -- src/detection/detect-pii.ts` is empty)
- [ ] `detect-pii.characterization.test.ts` still passes (ship gate preserved)
- [ ] `detect-pii.integration.test.ts` still passes
- [ ] `detect-all.test.ts` has ~50 tests, all passing
- [ ] `detect-all.integration.test.ts` has ~10 tests, all passing
- [ ] No `try` keyword in `detect-all.ts` (`grep -n '\btry\b' src/detection/detect-all.ts` returns nothing)
- [ ] `DEFAULT_LEVEL` constant is exactly `"standard"`
- [ ] `buildAllTargetsFromZip` returns `readonly string[]`, longest-first sorted
- [ ] Structural `referent` contributes to targets, `label` does NOT
- [ ] Per-scope language detection works (verified by group 2 test 4)
- [ ] Identifier-partition invariant holds: on a pure-identifier input, the target set from `buildAllTargetsFromZip` equals the target set from legacy `buildTargetsFromZip` (verified by group 4 test 1)
- [ ] `engine.ts` migration test (§ 8.5) passes on the worst-case fixture
- [ ] `engine.test.ts` has 18 tests total (17 Phase 0 + 1 Phase 1) — no existing test was modified, added, or deleted other than the one appended in § 8.5

---

## 9. `rules/financial.ts` — 10 regex rules

Ten financial detection rules covering Korean won, US dollar, foreign currencies, percentages, fractions, and label-driven amount context. All are pure regex with optional post-filters — no heuristics, no parsers. File targets ~250 lines of TypeScript + ~250 lines of tests.

### 9.1 Category overview

| # | id | Languages | Levels | What it catches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `financial.won-amount` | `["ko"]` | C, S, P | Korean won with 원 suffix: `50,000원`, `1000원`, `1,500.50원` |
| 2 | `financial.won-unit` | `["ko"]` | S, P | Korean unit amounts: `1억원`, `500만원`, `3천만원`, `1조원` |
| 3 | `financial.won-formal` | `["universal"]` | C, S, P | Formal KRW marker: `₩50,000`, `KRW 50,000,000` |
| 4 | `financial.usd-symbol` | `["universal"]` | C, S, P | Dollar symbol: `$50,000`, `$1.99`, `$50,000.00` |
| 5 | `financial.usd-code` | `["universal"]` | C, S, P | USD code form: `USD 50,000`, `US$ 50,000` |
| 6 | `financial.foreign-symbol` | `["universal"]` | S, P | `€50,000`, `£1,000`, `¥10,000` |
| 7 | `financial.foreign-code` | `["universal"]` | S, P | ISO codes: `EUR 50,000`, `GBP 1,000`, `JPY 10,000`, `CNY 50,000`, `CHF / AUD / CAD / HKD / SGD` |
| 8 | `financial.percentage` | `["universal"]` | S, P | `15%`, `15.5%`, `15 퍼센트`, `15 프로` |
| 9 | `financial.fraction-ko` | `["ko"]` | P | `3분의 1`, `4분의 3`, `10분의 1` |
| 10 | `financial.amount-context-ko` | `["ko"]` | S, P | Label-driven: `금액: 1,000,000`, `보증금 5억`, `매매대금 50,000,000원` |

Legend: **C** = conservative, **S** = standard, **P** = paranoid.

### 9.2 Normalization assumptions (read before writing patterns)

By the time a regex rule sees the text, `normalizeForMatching` has already applied the following transformations (see `src/detection/normalize.ts` for the authoritative list — do NOT re-apply these in the regex):

- **Fullwidth ASCII folded to halfwidth.** `５０，０００` becomes `50,000`. `＄` becomes `$`. The regex can assume digits, commas, periods, dollar signs, and spaces are all ASCII.
- **CJK space (U+3000) → ASCII space.** Use `\s` normally; don't worry about the CJK space.
- **Smart quotes → ASCII quotes.** Not relevant for financial, but worth knowing.
- **Hyphens (en-dash, em-dash, minus sign, fullwidth hyphen, etc.) → ASCII hyphen.** Not used in financial regex but worth knowing for temporal.
- **Zero-width characters stripped.** `50\u200B,000` becomes `50,000`.

**NOT normalized** (the regex must handle these as-is):

- **Korean currency symbol `₩` (U+20A9).** Passes through unchanged. The `financial.won-formal` rule matches it literally.
- **Euro `€` (U+20AC), pound `£` (U+00A3), yen `¥` (U+00A5).** Pass through unchanged. The `financial.foreign-symbol` rule matches them literally.
- **Korean syllables.** Passed through as whatever codepoints the input had. **The rules below assume the input is NFC-composed** (single-codepoint Hangul syllables), which is how Word and all modern editors emit Korean by default. Jamo-decomposed input (e.g., `원` instead of `원`) is an acknowledged edge case that these rules do not handle; Phase 0's characterization fixture is all NFC, so the invariant holds for the existing test suite. A future hardening phase may add jamo handling, but it is out of scope for Phase 1.
- **Korean number words (만, 억, 조, 천).** The regex matches them as literal UTF-16 sequences. They are not normalized away.

```typescript
/**
 * Financial category — money amounts, percentages, fractions.
 *
 * Ten regex rules covering:
 *
 *   1. Korean won with 원 suffix (digit form)
 *   2. Korean won with unit word (억/만/천/조)
 *   3. Formal KRW marker (₩ / KRW)
 *   4. US dollar symbol ($)
 *   5. US dollar code (USD / US$)
 *   6. Foreign currency symbol (€ £ ¥)
 *   7. Foreign currency code (EUR GBP JPY CNY ...)
 *   8. Percentage (% 퍼센트 프로)
 *   9. Korean fraction (N분의 M)
 *  10. Label-driven amount context (금액:, 보증금, ...)
 *
 * All rules return `confidence: 1.0` via the standard runner (see
 * `runRegexPhase`). Two post-filters reject out-of-range values: KRW amounts
 * above ~999조원 (likely typos or account numbers) and percentages above
 * 10,000% (almost certainly not a valid financial claim).
 *
 * See:
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 9 — authoritative rule specs
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 2.2 — category boundary resolution
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 7 — ReDoS checklist (every pattern in this file
 *     was audited against the 50ms budget)
 *
 * NORMALIZATION: this file assumes `normalizeForMatching` has already folded
 * fullwidth digits and punctuation to ASCII. Do NOT match `０`, `，`, `．` —
 * they are already `0`, `,`, `.` by the time the regex sees them. See
 * src/detection/normalize.ts and § 9.2 of the phase-1 brief.

### 9.4 Per-rule deep dive

#### 9.4.1 `financial.won-amount`

**Pattern:** `(?<![\d.])(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d+)?\s*원`

**Matches (positive, minimum 3):**
- `"50,000원"` → captures `50,000원`
- `"1000원"` (no commas, short form) → captures `1000원`
- `"1,500.50원"` (decimal) → captures `1,500.50원`

**Variants (minimum 3):**
- `"50000원"` (no commas, long bare form)
- `"50,000  원"` (multiple spaces)
- `"50,000원입니다"` (followed by Korean particle — match is `50,000원`, leaves `입니다`)

**Boundaries (minimum 3):**
- Start of string: `"50,000원 is the total"` → matches at offset 0
- End of string: `"Total: 50,000원"` → matches at end
- Punctuation adjacent: `"(50,000원)"` → matches `50,000원`, leaves parens

**Rejects (must NOT match, minimum 3):**
- `"2024년"` (year suffix 년, not 원 currency) — no match
- `"1500000000000000000원"` (post-filter rejects as > 999조원)
- `"원"` alone (no digit prefix) — no match

**ReDoS:** benign. The repetition `(?:,\d{3})+` is linear — each `,\d{3}` consumes 4 characters deterministically. The optional `(?:\.\d+)?` is also linear. No nested quantifiers. Passes the 50ms fuzz budget easily.

**Known false positive:** `"1.5원칙"` (version 1.5 principle — 원칙 means "principle" with 원 as first syllable of a compound word). The regex matches `1.5원` and leaves `칙`. Documented limitation; a future hygiene pass may add a lookahead blacklist for common 원-prefixed compound words (원칙, 원인, 원래, 원본, 원자, 원점, 원문, 원어, 원고, 원리, 원유, 원자력, ...). Phase 1 does NOT add this blacklist.

**Level rationale:** Conservative tier because the 원 suffix makes this one of the most unambiguous financial signals in Korean text. Contracts that mention any won amount should always have these redacted regardless of tier.

#### 9.4.2 `financial.won-unit`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)\d+(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d+)?\s*(?:천만|천억|천|만|억|조)\s*원`

**Alternation order matters.** `천만` and `천억` MUST come before `천` in the alternation list. The regex engine tries alternatives left-to-right and uses the first match, so with `(?:천|천만)` the engine would match the bare `천` and never try `천만`, producing wrong candidate boundaries on text like `"3천만원"`. This is a load-bearing ordering decision, NOT a cosmetic one.

**Matches:**
- `"1억원"` → `1억원`
- `"500만원"` → `500만원`
- `"3천만원"` → `3천만원`
- `"1조원"` → `1조원`
- `"1,000만원"` (comma inside digit block) → `1,000만원`

**Variants:**
- `"500 만원"` (space between digit and unit)
- `"500만 원"` (space between unit and 원)
- `"500 만 원"` (spaces both sides)

**Rejects:**
- `"500만"` (no 원 suffix) — no match
- `"천만원"` (no digit prefix) — no match
- `"만원"` alone — no match

**Level rationale:** Standard + Paranoid but NOT Conservative. The unit-word form overlaps with calendrical phrases like `"1억 년 전"` (100 million years ago); the required 원 suffix prevents most false positives, but conservative tier errs on the side of zero-false-positive rules.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.3 `financial.won-formal`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])(?:₩\s*|KRW\s+)(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d+)?`

**Matches:**
- `"₩50,000"` → `₩50,000`
- `"₩ 50,000"` (space after ₩) → `₩ 50,000`
- `"KRW 50,000,000"` → `KRW 50,000,000`
- `"KRW 1000"` (no commas) → `KRW 1000`

**Boundaries:**
- Left boundary `(?<![A-Za-z])` rejects `"FOOKRW 50,000"` — the `K` of `KRW` has `O` before it (letter), so the negative lookbehind fails. No match. Prevents matching inside identifiers.

**Rejects:**
- `"KRW"` alone — no digits
- `"₩"` alone — no digits
- `"krw 50,000"` lowercase — pattern is case-sensitive (no `i` flag), so lowercase does not match. Intentional: lowercase `krw` in a contract is extremely rare and likely noise.

**Language rationale:** `"universal"` because `₩` and `KRW` appear in English-language documents describing Korean transactions. A purely-English contract between a US buyer and Korean seller may use `KRW 50,000,000` without any Korean text elsewhere.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.4 `financial.usd-symbol`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z\d])\$\s*(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d{1,2})?`

**Decimal digit limit of `{1,2}`.** USD is always 2-decimal currency. Allowing arbitrary decimals (`\.\d+`) would let `$100.0000001` match, which is suspicious for money. Cap at 2.

**Matches:**
- `"$50,000"` → `$50,000`
- `"$1.99"` → `$1.99`
- `"$100.00"` → `$100.00`
- `"$0.50"` → `$0.50`
- `"$50000"` (no commas) → `$50000`

**Variants:**
- `"$ 50,000"` (space after `$`)
- `"$50,000.00"` (commas and decimals)

**Boundaries:**
- Left boundary `(?<![A-Za-z\d])` rejects `"US$100"` — the `$` has `S` before it, which is a letter. That match is caught by `usd-code` instead. Prevents double-counting across the two rules.

**Rejects:**
- `"US$100"` (caught by `usd-code`, not `usd-symbol`)
- `"$"` alone (no digits)

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.5 `financial.usd-code`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])(?:USD\s+|US\$\s*)(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d{1,2})?`

**Matches:**
- `"USD 50,000"` → `USD 50,000`
- `"USD 1,000,000.00"` → full match
- `"US$ 100"` → `US$ 100`
- `"US$100"` (no space) → `US$100`

**Variants:**
- `"USD   50,000"` (extra whitespace)
- `"usd 50,000"` lowercase — pattern is case-sensitive, does not match. Intentional.

**Rule interaction:** `"US$100"` matches here (via the `US\$` branch) and does NOT match `usd-symbol` (which requires no letter before `$`). No double-counting.

**Rejects:**
- `"USD"` alone — no digits
- `"US$"` alone — no digits

**Acceptable false positive:** `"AUDIT USD 100"` — the character directly before `U` is a space, not a letter, so lookbehind passes. Matches `USD 100`. This is CORRECT behavior: even inside the phrase `"AUDIT USD 100"`, the substring `USD 100` is a legitimate money amount and should be redacted.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.6 `financial.foreign-symbol`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z\d])[€£¥]\s*(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d{1,2})?`

**Matches:**
- `"€50,000"` → `€50,000`
- `"£1,000"` → `£1,000`
- `"¥10,000"` → `¥10,000`
- `"€ 50.00"` (space after symbol, 2 decimals)

**Language rationale:** `"universal"` — these symbols appear in documents of any language.

**Note on yen vs yuan.** The symbol `¥` is used for both JPY and CNY historically. In modern practice, CNY uses `元` or `¥` depending on context. This rule catches the symbol `¥` without disambiguating the currency — downstream redaction does not need to know which. The ISO-code form `CNY 50,000` is caught by `foreign-code`.

**Rejects:**
- Chinese `元` character alone — not in the character class `[€£¥]`, so not matched. Acknowledged limitation; a future hygiene pass may add `元`.
- `¥` alone — no digits, no match.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.7 `financial.foreign-code`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])(?:EUR|GBP|JPY|CNY|CHF|AUD|CAD|HKD|SGD)\s+(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d{1,2})?`

**Currency code list:** 9 major codes covering Europe (EUR, GBP, CHF), Asia-Pacific (JPY, CNY, HKD, SGD), and Commonwealth (AUD, CAD). Excluded: SEK, NOK, DKK, NZD, INR, BRL, MXN, RUB, ZAR, KRW (KRW is caught by `won-formal`). A future hygiene pass may extend the list; Phase 1 targets the 9 most common in Korean–English cross-border contracts.

**Required space after code:** `\s+` not `\s*`. Reason: `EUR50` is almost always a concatenated identifier (e.g., product code), not a currency amount. Requiring at least one space after the code eliminates most such false positives.

**Matches:**
- `"EUR 50,000"` → `EUR 50,000`
- `"GBP 1,000"` → `GBP 1,000`
- `"JPY 10,000"` → `JPY 10,000`
- `"CNY 50,000"` → `CNY 50,000`

**Rejects:**
- `"EUR50"` (no space, likely product code) — no match
- `"EUROPE 50"` — the engine tries `EUR` at position 0, then requires `\s+`, but the next character is `O`, not whitespace. Fails all 9 code alternatives. No match overall. Correct.
- `"EUR"` alone — no match

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.8 `financial.percentage`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)\d+(?:\.\d+)?\s*(?:%|퍼센트|프로)`

**Matches:**
- `"15%"` → `15%`
- `"15.5%"` → `15.5%`
- `"15 %"` (space) → `15 %`
- `"15퍼센트"` → `15퍼센트`
- `"15 퍼센트"` (space) → `15 퍼센트`
- `"15 프로"` → `15 프로`

**Boundaries:**
- `(?<!\d)` prevents `"2015%"` from being interpreted as `015%` starting at position 1. With the lookbehind, the engine starts at position 0 and matches `2015%` as a single number.

**Rejects:**
- `"15개"` (15 pieces) — no `%` or percentage word
- `"%"` alone — no digits
- `"15000%"` → matches regex, post-filter rejects (> 10,000%)
- `"0.00001%"` → matches regex, post-filter accepts (0 ≤ 0.00001 ≤ 10,000)

**Acceptable false positive:** `"버전 5%"` could match `5%`, but this is rare outside informal text and the downstream redactor handles it safely (worst case: the `5%` is redacted when it was just informational).

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.9 `financial.fraction-ko`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)\d+\s*분의\s*\d+(?!\d)`

**Matches:**
- `"3분의 1"` → `3분의 1`
- `"3분의1"` (no space) → `3분의1`
- `"100분의 20"` → `100분의 20`

**Boundaries:**
- `(?<!\d)` prevents matching mid-number
- `(?!\d)` prevents capturing only part of a trailing number (on `"3분의 12"`, the engine correctly matches `3분의 12`, not `3분의 1`)

**Rejects:**
- `"3분간"` (3 minutes) — required `분의`, not `분간`
- `"분의"` alone — no digits
- `"1/3"` — not the Korean fraction form, not matched (a future universal-fraction rule may catch this)

**Level rationale:** Paranoid only. Fractions are rarely redaction targets in contracts — they usually denote shares or ownership ratios that are legitimate content, not PII.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 9.4.10 `financial.amount-context-ko`

**Pattern:** `(?<=(?:금액|총액|보증금|매매대금|계약금|잔금|지급액|수수료|단가|대금)\s*[:：]?\s*)(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})+|\d+)(?:\.\d+)?(?:\s*(?:원|만원|억원|천원))?`

**Variable-length lookbehind:** ES2018+ feature. Supported in Node 18+ and all modern browsers. The tsconfig/vite target is ES2022, so this is fine. No polyfill needed.

**Label list:** 10 Korean financial-context nouns. NOT exhaustive by design — adding every possible label would be a maintenance burden and a slippery slope to hardcoded-entity-names (RULES_GUIDE § 12.2 anti-pattern). These 10 cover the overwhelming majority of labeled amounts in Korean contracts. Adding new labels in a future hygiene phase is cheap (just append to the alternation).

**Matches:**
- `"금액: 1,000,000"` → captures only `1,000,000` (label consumed by lookbehind)
- `"금액 5억"` (no colon, with Korean unit) → captures `5억`
- `"보증금: 50,000,000원"` → captures `50,000,000원`
- `"매매대금 100,000,000"` → captures `100,000,000`

**Rejects:**
- `"금액"` alone (no following digit) — no match
- `"1,000,000"` (no label) — no match
- `"시간 30"` (label `시간` not in the approved list) — no match

**Interaction with won-amount:** `"보증금: 50,000,000원"` is matched by BOTH this rule (which captures the digit portion including the optional 원 suffix) AND `won-amount` (which captures `50,000,000원`). Both emit candidates. Dedup happens later in `buildAllTargetsFromZip` on identical text. Since both captures include the trailing `원`, the strings are identical and the Set dedup collapses them to one target.

**ReDoS consideration:** variable-length lookbehind has higher cost than fixed-length. Worst case: the engine scans backwards up to `max(label_length) + punctuation + whitespace` characters. That is bounded — the longest label `매매대금` is 4 characters, plus colon, plus a few spaces. Passes the 50ms budget.

**Level rationale:** Standard + Paranoid. The label requirement makes it very low-false-positive, but it is NOT Conservative because the label list is inherently incomplete — a real contract could use a label not in the list and this rule would miss it, which means `conservative` (zero-miss tier for its scope) would need to be broader.

### 9.5 Test file specification (`rules/financial.test.ts`)

Create `src/detection/rules/financial.test.ts`. Per RULES_GUIDE § 8.1, minimum per-rule test set is 13 cases (3 positive, 3 variants, 3 boundary, 3 reject, 1 ReDoS adversarial). Ten rules × 13 tests = **130 tests minimum**. Target ~140 tests to allow a few extras per rule for tricky edge cases (`won-amount` has 원-compound-word ambiguity; `amount-context-ko` has variable-length lookbehind edge cases worth explicit coverage).

  });

  // ... 10 more tests per § 9.4.1 (variants, boundaries, rejects, ReDoS)
});

// ... one describe block per rule, 9 more
```

**Quality rubric (per RULES_GUIDE § 8.3).** Every rule's test block must earn **★★★** (3 stars):

- ★ 3 positive matches covering the rule's stated purpose
- ★ 3 variant matches covering the normalization surface (whitespace, comma presence, decimal, unit word placement)
- ★ 3 rejects covering the top false-positive risks identified in § 9.4

Rules that earn fewer than 3 stars do not ship.

**Test case naming:** use behavior-first describe titles, e.g., `it("matches a bare-digit amount without commas")`, NOT symbol-first (`it("tests FINANCIAL[0]")`). The behavior description is what future contributors will read when the test fails.

**ReDoS adversarial test per rule.** Include one test per rule that runs the pattern against a 10KB pathological input drawn from the rule's character class. Example for `won-amount`:

```typescript
it("is ReDoS-safe on pathological comma input", () => {
  const input = "1" + ",000".repeat(2500) + "원"; // ~10KB
  const start = Date.now();
  const matches = matchOne("won-amount", input);
  const elapsed = Date.now() - start;
  expect(elapsed).toBeLessThan(50); // 50ms budget per RULES_GUIDE § 7
  // The match itself is optional — the test is about not hanging.
  void matches;
});
```

The dedicated `_framework/redos-guard.test.ts` fuzz test already covers this category-wide, but per-rule smoke tests catch regressions faster when an individual rule is tweaked.

### 9.6 Registry integration

Extend `src/detection/_framework/registry.ts` to include FINANCIAL rules in `ALL_REGEX_RULES`. The diff:

```typescript
// Before (runner-extension commit — § 7.9):
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
// ... other imports
export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...FINANCIAL (§ 9)
  //   ...TEMPORAL  (§ 10)
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;

// After (§ 9 commit):
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
import { FINANCIAL } from "../rules/financial.js";
// ... other imports
export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  ...FINANCIAL,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...TEMPORAL  (§ 10)
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;
```

The registry's `verifyRegistry()` function (Phase 0, unchanged) runs at module load and validates:

- All `financial.*` ids are unique (no collision with identifier ids)
- All patterns have the `g` flag
- All `levels` and `languages` arrays are non-empty
- All descriptions are non-empty
- All ids start with `financial.` and end with their `subcategory`

If any of these fail, the import throws. **Do not catch this error.** Fix the rule definition and re-run. The failure surfaces at test discovery time, which is the earliest possible point — exactly the fail-fast semantics Phase 0 § 11 chose.

### 9.7 Acceptance checklist for § 9

Before committing the financial rules, verify every item:

- [ ] `src/detection/rules/financial.ts` exists and exports `FINANCIAL: readonly RegexRule[]`
- [ ] `FINANCIAL.length === 10`
- [ ] Every rule's id starts with `"financial."`
- [ ] Every rule has `category: "financial"`
- [ ] Every rule's pattern has the `g` flag
- [ ] Two rules (`won-amount`, `percentage`) have post-filters; the other eight do not
- [ ] `wonAmountInRange` rejects values above 999,999,999,999,999 and values at or below 0
- [ ] `percentageInRange` rejects values above 10,000 and below 0
- [ ] `rules/financial.test.ts` has ≥ 130 tests, all passing
- [ ] `rules/financial.test.ts` exercises all 10 rules (no orphan rule without a describe block)
- [ ] Every describe block earns ★★★ on the quality rubric
- [ ] Registry update: `ALL_REGEX_RULES` includes `...FINANCIAL` immediately after `...IDENTIFIERS`
- [ ] Registry verification passes at module load (no duplicate ids, no malformed rules)
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.characterization.test.ts` still passes byte-for-byte — financial rules do not affect identifier output because they have a different category and disjoint patterns
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.integration.test.ts` still passes
- [ ] `bun run test` overall test count increases by ≥ 130 (financial tests) + 4 (registry tests) = ≥ 134 in this commit
- [ ] ReDoS guard fuzz passes for all 10 financial rules (`bun run test src/detection/_framework/redos-guard.test.ts` with the new rules registered)
- [ ] No new npm dependencies added
- [ ] No edits to `src/detection/patterns.ts`, `detect-pii.ts`, `detect-pii.characterization.test.ts`, `detect-pii.integration.test.ts`, `detect-pii.test.ts`, or any Phase 0 file other than `registry.ts`

## 10. `rules/temporal.ts` — 8 regex rules

Eight temporal detection rules covering Korean and English calendar dates, durations, and label-driven date context. File targets ~200 lines of TypeScript + ~200 lines of tests. Structure mirrors § 9 exactly so Codex can use § 9 as a template when authoring.

### 10.1 Category overview

| # | id | Languages | Levels | What it catches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `temporal.date-ko-full` | `["ko"]` | C, S, P | `2024년 3월 15일`, `2024년3월15일`, `2024년 03월 15일` |
| 2 | `temporal.date-ko-short` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `2024.3.15`, `2024-3-15`, `2024/3/15`, `2024.03.15` |
| 3 | `temporal.date-ko-range` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `2024년 3월 15일부터 2024년 6월 30일까지`, `2024.3.15 ~ 2024.6.30` |
| 4 | `temporal.date-iso` | `["universal"]` | C, S, P | Strict ISO 8601: `2024-03-15`, `2024-03-15T14:30:00Z` |
| 5 | `temporal.date-en` | `["en"]` | S, P | `March 15, 2024`, `15 March 2024`, `Mar. 15, 2024` |
| 6 | `temporal.duration-ko` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `3년간`, `6개월`, `90일간`, `2주`, `24시간` |
| 7 | `temporal.duration-en` | `["en"]` | S, P | `3 years`, `6 months`, `90 days`, `2 weeks` |
| 8 | `temporal.date-context-ko` | `["ko"]` | C, S, P | Label + date: `계약일: 2024.3.15`, `체결일 2024년 3월 15일`, `시행일: 2024-03-15` |

Legend: **C** = conservative, **S** = standard, **P** = paranoid.

### 10.2 Normalization and language-filter assumptions

Same normalization assumptions as § 9.2 apply (fullwidth folded to halfwidth, CJK space → ASCII space, hyphen variants → ASCII hyphen, NFC Hangul assumption). Re-read § 9.2 before writing patterns — do not re-apply these transformations inside the regex.

**Temporal-specific notes:**

- **Hyphen variants matter.** Korean dates are commonly written with en-dashes (`2024–03–15`) or em-dashes. `normalizeForMatching` folds all of these to ASCII `-`, so the regex only needs to match ASCII `-`. Do NOT include `–—‒‑−` in the separator character class.
- **Fullwidth period and slash.** `2024．3．15` and `2024／3／15` are pre-folded to `2024.3.15` and `2024/3/15`. Regex uses ASCII only.
- **Korean `년`, `월`, `일` are not normalized.** They pass through as single-codepoint Hangul syllables (assuming NFC input). The regex matches them literally.
- **Language filter interaction.** The language filter (per § 7 runner) skips rules whose `languages` array excludes the detected document language. For a pure-English document, rules 1–3, 6, 8 (all `["ko"]`) are skipped; rules 4–5, 7 run. For a pure-Korean document, only rules 5, 7 (`["en"]`) are skipped; rule 4 (`["universal"]`) always runs. For a `"mixed"` document, every temporal rule runs. This is the expected behavior and matches RULES_GUIDE § 11.2.

### 10.3 Full file content (`rules/temporal.ts`)

Put this EXACTLY into `src/detection/rules/temporal.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Temporal category — calendar dates, durations, date-range phrases.
 *
 * Eight regex rules covering:
 *
 *   1. Korean full date (2024년 3월 15일)
 *   2. Korean short date (2024.3.15 / 2024-3-15 / 2024/3/15)
 *   3. Korean date range (2024년 3월 15일부터 2024년 6월 30일까지)
 *   4. ISO 8601 date with optional time (2024-03-15, 2024-03-15T14:30:00Z)
 *   5. English date (March 15, 2024 / 15 March 2024)
 *   6. Korean duration (3년간 / 6개월 / 90일간)
 *   7. English duration (3 years / 6 months / 90 days)
 *   8. Label-driven Korean date context (계약일: 2024.3.15)
 *
 * Two post-filters validate calendar dates: `validNumericDate` checks
 * month/day ranges and month-specific day counts (Feb 30 is rejected) for
 * the numeric and Korean date forms; `validEnglishDate` does the same for
 * the English month-name form. Duration and range rules are not post-
 * filtered — duration has no calendar semantics, and range over-matching
 * is accepted as an acknowledged edge case.
 *
 * See:
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 10 — authoritative rule specs
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 2.3 — temporal category boundary
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 7 — ReDoS checklist
 *
 * NORMALIZATION: this file assumes `normalizeForMatching` has already folded
 * fullwidth digits, hyphen variants, and CJK space. See § 10.2 of the
 * phase-1 brief and src/detection/normalize.ts for the authoritative list.

### 10.4 Per-rule deep dive

#### 10.4.1 `temporal.date-ko-full`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)(?:19|20)\d{2}년\s*(?:1[0-2]|0?[1-9])월\s*(?:3[01]|[12]\d|0?[1-9])일`

**Year bound `19|20`.** The year must start with `19` or `20` — i.e., 1900–2099. This rejects `9999년`, `1000년`, and similar typos. Historical contract references (e.g., Seoul Olympics 1988) still match.

**Month class `(?:1[0-2]|0?[1-9])`.** Matches `1`–`12` with or without zero-padding. Order: `1[0-2]` first (greedy preference for 10/11/12), then `0?[1-9]` for single-digit months.

**Day class `(?:3[01]|[12]\d|0?[1-9])`.** Matches `1`–`31`. Month-specific day validation (April has 30, February has 28/29) is delegated to the `validNumericDate` post-filter.

**Matches:**
- `"2024년 3월 15일"` → `2024년 3월 15일`
- `"2024년3월15일"` (no spaces) → `2024년3월15일`
- `"2024년 03월 15일"` (zero-padded month) → `2024년 03월 15일`

**Variants:**
- `"2024년  3월  15일"` (multiple spaces)
- `"2024년 12월 31일"` (end-of-year)
- `"1988년 9월 17일"` (historical)

**Boundaries:**
- Start/end of string
- Adjacent punctuation: `"(2024년 3월 15일)"` → matches the date, leaves parens
- Korean particle after: `"2024년 3월 15일에"` → matches the date, leaves `에`

**Rejects:**
- `"2024년 13월 15일"` (month 13) — regex rejects (no `13` in month class)
- `"2024년 2월 30일"` (Feb 30) — regex matches, post-filter rejects (Feb has 28/29 days)
- `"9999년 3월 15일"` (year 9999) — regex rejects (year prefix must be `19|20`)

**ReDoS:** benign. No nested quantifiers. Each `\s*` is bounded by a required literal Hangul syllable, preventing runaway backtracking.

#### 10.4.2 `temporal.date-ko-short`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)(?:19|20)\d{2}[.\-/](?:1[0-2]|0?[1-9])[.\-/](?:3[01]|[12]\d|0?[1-9])(?!\d)`

**Separator class `[.\-/]`.** Accepts dot, hyphen, or slash. The three separators can be MIXED within a single date (e.g., `2024.3-15` technically matches), which is weird but not harmful — dedup collapses identical strings later.

**Why `(?!\d)` at the end.** Prevents `2024.3.155` from matching as `2024.3.15` with a trailing `5` left over.

**Matches:**
- `"2024.3.15"` → `2024.3.15`
- `"2024-3-15"` → `2024-3-15`
- `"2024/3/15"` → `2024/3/15`
- `"2024.03.15"` (zero-padded) → `2024.03.15`

**Rule interaction with `date-iso`.** `"2024-03-15"` matches BOTH `date-ko-short` (via `[.\-/]` class) AND `date-iso` (strict form). Both emit candidates with identical `text`. Dedup in `buildAllTargetsFromZip` collapses them. This is intended — two rules both confirming the same match is a feature (higher confidence in downstream analytics), not a bug.

**Rejects:**
- `"2024.13.15"` (month 13) — regex rejects
- `"2024.2.30"` (Feb 30) — regex matches, post-filter rejects
- `"v2024.3.15"` — the `v` before `2` is not a digit (lookbehind passes), so regex matches. Accepted limitation — `v2024.3.15` as a version string is rare in contracts.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 10.4.3 `temporal.date-ko-range`

**Pattern:** see § 10.3. Two `date-ko-full`-style date patterns joined by `\s*(?:부터|~|-)\s*` with an optional `\s*까지` suffix.

**Matches:**
- `"2024년 3월 15일부터 2024년 6월 30일까지"` → full phrase
- `"2024년 3월 15일 ~ 2024년 6월 30일"` → with `~` separator
- `"2024년 3월 15일 - 2024년 6월 30일"` → with hyphen separator
- `"2024년 3월 15일부터 2024년 6월 30일"` → without `까지`

**Rejects:**
- `"2024년 3월 15일"` alone (no range) — no match
- `"2024년 3월 15일부터"` without end date — no match
- `"2024.3.15 ~ 2024.6.30"` — the range rule only matches the full `년/월/일` form. The short form range is NOT supported in Phase 1 (acknowledged limitation). Users who need it get two separate `date-ko-short` matches from the two dates, which is equally useful for redaction.

**No post-filter.** Range matches are accepted verbatim. Invalid date components inside a range (e.g., `2024년 2월 30일부터 ...`) match but are not rejected; this is a rare edge case and the harm is a false positive redaction of an invalid date string, which is harmless.

**Level rationale:** Standard + Paranoid. Not Conservative because the pattern is long and the combined surface allows unusual forms to slip through occasionally.

**ReDoS:** benign. The two date sub-patterns are concatenated with a required separator, so there is no overlap between them.

#### 10.4.4 `temporal.date-iso`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)(?:19|20)\d{2}-(?:1[0-2]|0[1-9])-(?:3[01]|[12]\d|0[1-9])(?:T(?:[01]\d|2[0-3]):[0-5]\d(?::[0-5]\d)?(?:Z|[+-](?:[01]\d|2[0-3]):?[0-5]\d)?)?(?!\d)`

**Strict zero-padding.** Month and day classes require `0[1-9]`, not `0?[1-9]`. `2024-3-15` does NOT match this rule (it matches `date-ko-short` instead). ISO 8601 mandates zero-padding; respecting that is what makes this rule the "conservative" one.

**Optional time component.** `T` followed by `HH:MM`, optional `:SS`, and optional timezone (`Z` or `±HH:MM` or `±HHMM`). All RFC 3339 datetime forms.

**Matches:**
- `"2024-03-15"` (date only)
- `"2024-03-15T14:30:00Z"` (full UTC)
- `"2024-03-15T14:30:00+09:00"` (KST offset)
- `"2024-03-15T14:30"` (date + HH:MM only)

**Rejects:**
- `"2024-3-15"` (not zero-padded) — no match (caught by `date-ko-short` instead)
- `"2024-03-15T25:00:00Z"` (hour 25) — regex rejects (hour class is `[01]\d|2[0-3]`)
- `"2024-02-30"` — regex matches, post-filter rejects

**Language rationale:** `"universal"`. ISO 8601 is language-neutral and appears in technical documents of any language.

**Level rationale:** Conservative. The strict form is near-zero false positive — if a string looks like `2024-03-15`, it IS an ISO date.

**ReDoS:** benign. The time component has a fixed maximum length and no nested quantifiers.

#### 10.4.5 `temporal.date-en`

**Pattern:** see § 10.3. Two branches combined with alternation: `Day Month` and `Month Day,?`, both followed by a required 4-digit year.

**Month name list:** full names and common abbreviations (`Jan` through `Dec`, with optional period). Note that `"May"` appears in the full-name list only — `"May."` with period is unusual and accepted, but `"May"` is ambiguous with the modal verb. The post-filter does not resolve this ambiguity; accept occasional false positives.

**Ordinal suffix** `(?:st|nd|rd|th)?` — optional, matches `"15th"`, `"1st"`, etc. Note: after the ordinal, a comma is optional (`"March 15, 2024"` and `"March 15 2024"` both match).

**Matches:**
- `"March 15, 2024"` (MDY)
- `"March 15 2024"` (MDY no comma)
- `"Mar. 15, 2024"` (MDY abbreviated)
- `"15 March 2024"` (DMY)
- `"15 Mar 2024"` (DMY abbreviated)
- `"March 15th, 2024"` (with ordinal)
- `"September 3, 2024"` — `Sept` vs `Sep` both acceptable

**Rejects:**
- `"March 2024"` (no day) — no match
- `"March 15"` (no year) — no match
- `"March 32, 2024"` — regex rejects (day class)
- `"February 30, 2024"` — regex matches, post-filter rejects

**Language rationale:** `"en"`. English-only rule. Running on Korean text would be noise.

**Level rationale:** Standard + Paranoid. The `"May"` ambiguity prevents conservative tier.

**ReDoS:** benign. The outer alternation has disjoint prefixes (digit vs letter), so backtracking between branches is bounded.

#### 10.4.6 `temporal.duration-ko`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)\d+\s*(?:년간|개월|달|주간|주|일간|시간)`

**Why `년간` not `년`.** `년` alone is ambiguous with the year suffix in `date-ko-full` (`2024년`). The unambiguous duration form requires `년간` ("for N years"). Contracts that write `3년` without `간` are treated as ambiguous and NOT matched by this rule — user's responsibility to write `3년간` if they want detection. Acknowledged limitation.

**Why `일간` not `일`.** Same reason — `일` alone is the day suffix in `date-ko-full`.

**Unit list:** `년간`, `개월`, `달`, `주간`, `주`, `일간`, `시간`. The alternation puts longer forms first where they would otherwise shadow (`년간` before any `년`-like form; no standalone `년` in this rule).

**Matches:**
- `"3년간"` → `3년간`
- `"6개월"` → `6개월`
- `"90일간"` → `90일간`
- `"2주"` → `2주`
- `"24시간"` → `24시간`
- `"3 년간"` (space) → `3 년간`

**Rejects:**
- `"2024년"` (date year) — no `간` suffix, not in unit list, no match
- `"3일"` (date day) — no `간`, no match
- `"년간"` alone (no digit) — no match

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 10.4.7 `temporal.duration-en`

**Pattern:** `(?<!\d)\d+\s+(?:years?|months?|weeks?|days?|hours?)\b`

**Case insensitive (`/gi`).** The pattern uses `i` flag because English durations in contracts appear in mixed case (`"3 Years"`, `"6 MONTHS"`). The runner's invariant is that `g` must be present; `i` is allowed alongside.

**`\b` usage.** This rule is `languages: ["en"]`, so it runs only on English text. RULES_GUIDE § 12.1 warns about `\b` in CJK contexts — English rules are safe.

**Required `\s+` between number and unit.** `"3years"` (no space) does not match. Contracts almost always separate the number and unit with a space; `"3years"` concatenated is a compilation error or a typo.

**Matches:**
- `"3 years"` → `3 years`
- `"1 year"` (singular) → `1 year`
- `"6 months"` → `6 months`
- `"90 days"` → `90 days`
- `"2 weeks"` → `2 weeks`
- `"24 hours"` → `24 hours`
- `"3 Years"` (capitalized) → matches via `/i`

**Rejects:**
- `"3years"` (no space) — no match
- `"years"` alone — no match
- `"3 year old"` — matches `3 year` (the `old` is left over), which is a mild false positive acceptable for paranoid tier

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 10.4.8 `temporal.date-context-ko`

**Pattern:** see § 10.3. Variable-length lookbehind for Korean date labels (`계약일`, `체결일`, `시행일`, `효력발생일`, `만료일`, `종료일`, `발행일`, `작성일`, `기준일`) followed by either the Korean-full or Korean-short date form.

**Why two date forms in one rule.** The label-driven context is high-signal — if a label is present, the date format could be either form and we want to catch both. Splitting into two rules (`date-context-ko-full`, `date-context-ko-short`) would duplicate the label list.

**Variable-length lookbehind.** ES2018+. Same caveat as `financial.amount-context-ko` in § 9.4.10: supported in Node 18+, bounded performance (longest label is `효력발생일` at 5 characters).

**Matches:**
- `"계약일: 2024.3.15"` → `2024.3.15`
- `"체결일 2024년 3월 15일"` → `2024년 3월 15일`
- `"시행일: 2024-03-15"` → `2024-03-15`
- `"만료일: 2024.12.31"` → `2024.12.31`

**Rejects:**
- `"계약일"` alone (no date) — no match
- `"2024.3.15"` alone (no label) — no match (caught by `date-ko-short` separately)
- `"시간 2024.3.15"` (label `시간` not in list) — no match

**Level rationale:** Conservative. Label + valid date is the most reliable signal in the temporal category.

**Interaction with other temporal rules.** Context-labeled dates ALSO match `date-ko-full`, `date-ko-short`, or `date-iso` depending on form. Dedup collapses identical text. Higher-tier analytics downstream can see that a candidate fired on multiple rules as a confidence signal.

**ReDoS:** benign.

### 10.5 Test file specification (`rules/temporal.test.ts`)

Create `src/detection/rules/temporal.test.ts`. Per RULES_GUIDE § 8.1, minimum per-rule test set is 13 cases. Eight rules × 13 tests = **104 tests minimum**. Target ~115 tests to cover calendar validation edge cases (leap years, month-end days, timezone offsets).

**Organization:** mirror § 9.5 exactly. One `describe("TEMPORAL registry", …)` block with sanity tests (exports 8 rules, every id starts with `temporal.`, every pattern has the `g` flag, every rule has a non-empty description), then one `describe` per rule.

**Shared helpers (copy from § 9.5):**

```typescript
import { describe, expect, it } from "vitest";

import { runRegexPhase } from "../_framework/runner.js";
import type { RegexRule } from "../_framework/types.js";

import { TEMPORAL } from "./temporal.js";

function findRule(subcategory: string): RegexRule {
  const rule = TEMPORAL.find((r) => r.subcategory === subcategory);
  if (!rule) throw new Error(`Rule not found: ${subcategory}`);
  return rule;
}

function matchOne(subcategory: string, text: string): string[] {
  const rule = findRule(subcategory);
  return runRegexPhase(text, "paranoid", [rule]).map((c) => c.text);
}
```

**Calendar validation tests (add to each date-rule block):**

```typescript
describe("temporal.date-ko-full", () => {
  // ... 10 other tests ...

  it("rejects Feb 30 via post-filter", () => {
    expect(matchOne("date-ko-full", "2024년 2월 30일")).toEqual([]);
  });

  it("accepts Feb 29 on a leap year", () => {
    expect(matchOne("date-ko-full", "2024년 2월 29일")).toEqual([
      "2024년 2월 29일",
    ]);
  });

  it("rejects Feb 29 on a non-leap year", () => {
    expect(matchOne("date-ko-full", "2023년 2월 29일")).toEqual([]);
  });

  it("rejects April 31", () => {
    expect(matchOne("date-ko-full", "2024년 4월 31일")).toEqual([]);
  });
});
```

Similar calendar-validity tests go in `date-ko-short`, `date-iso`, `date-en`, and `date-context-ko` describe blocks (each gets ~4 calendar tests in addition to the 13-minimum base set).

**ReDoS adversarial test per rule.** One per rule against a 10KB pathological input. Example for `date-ko-range` (the longest and most backtrack-prone pattern):

```typescript
it("is ReDoS-safe on long range-like input", () => {
  const input = "2024년 3월 15일부터 ".repeat(500) + "2024년 6월 30일까지";
  const start = Date.now();
  const matches = matchOne("date-ko-range", input);
  expect(Date.now() - start).toBeLessThan(100);
  void matches;
});
```

**Quality rubric:** every rule's test block must earn ★★★ per RULES_GUIDE § 8.3 — 3 positive, 3 variants, 3 rejects, minimum.

### 10.6 Registry integration

Extend `src/detection/_framework/registry.ts` to include TEMPORAL rules. The diff builds on the § 9 state:

```typescript
// Before (§ 9 state):
import { FINANCIAL } from "../rules/financial.js";
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  ...FINANCIAL,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...TEMPORAL  (§ 10)
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;

// After (§ 10 commit):
import { FINANCIAL } from "../rules/financial.js";
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
import { TEMPORAL } from "../rules/temporal.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  ...FINANCIAL,
  ...TEMPORAL,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;
```

Registry verification at module load catches any malformed rule. Same fail-fast semantics as § 9.6.

### 10.7 Acceptance checklist for § 10

- [ ] `src/detection/rules/temporal.ts` exists and exports `TEMPORAL: readonly RegexRule[]`
- [ ] `TEMPORAL.length === 8`
- [ ] Every rule's id starts with `"temporal."`
- [ ] Every rule has `category: "temporal"`
- [ ] Every rule's pattern has the `g` flag (rule 7 also has `i`)
- [ ] Five rules have `validNumericDate` or `validEnglishDate` post-filter: `date-ko-full`, `date-ko-short`, `date-iso`, `date-en`, `date-context-ko`
- [ ] `isValidCalendarDate` rejects Feb 30, April 31, June 31, Sept 31, Nov 31
- [ ] `isValidCalendarDate` accepts Feb 29 in leap years (2024, 2020, 2000)
- [ ] `isValidCalendarDate` rejects Feb 29 in non-leap years (2023, 2021, 1900)
- [ ] `isValidCalendarDate` rejects years outside 1900–2100
- [ ] `MONTH_NAME_TO_NUM` has 12 months plus 10 abbreviations (Jan/Feb/Mar/Apr/Jun/Jul/Aug/Sep/Sept/Oct/Nov/Dec — "May" has no abbreviation)
- [ ] `rules/temporal.test.ts` has ≥ 104 tests, all passing
- [ ] Every describe block earns ★★★ on the quality rubric
- [ ] Registry update: `ALL_REGEX_RULES` includes `...TEMPORAL` immediately after `...FINANCIAL`
- [ ] Registry verification passes at module load
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.characterization.test.ts` still passes byte-for-byte
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.integration.test.ts` still passes
- [ ] `bun run test` overall test count increases by ≥ 104 (temporal tests) + 4 (registry sanity tests) = ≥ 108 in this commit
- [ ] ReDoS guard fuzz passes for all 8 temporal rules
- [ ] No new npm dependencies
- [ ] No edits to any Phase 0 file other than `registry.ts`
- [ ] Rule 3 (`date-ko-range`) has NO post-filter (acknowledged limitation documented in § 10.4.3)
- [ ] Rule 6 (`duration-ko`) and Rule 7 (`duration-en`) have NO post-filter (no calendar semantics to validate)

## 11. `rules/entities.ts` — 12 regex rules

Twelve entity detection rules covering Korean and English corporate forms, executive titles, honorifics, and label-driven identity context. File targets ~280 lines of TypeScript + ~280 lines of tests. Structure mirrors § 9 and § 10 exactly.

**No post-filters in this category.** Entity rules are inherently fuzzy (Korean names overlap with common words, English corporate suffixes match sentence-starters), and context-aware suppression belongs to the heuristic phase (§ 14) via role blacklists. Regex rules here stay pure per the architecture decision in § 4.

### 11.1 Category overview

| # | id | Languages | Levels | What it catches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `entities.ko-corp-prefix` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `주식회사 ABC`, `주식회사 삼성전자`, `주식회사 홍길동` |
| 2 | `entities.ko-corp-suffix` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `ABC 주식회사`, `삼성전자 주식회사` |
| 3 | `entities.ko-corp-abbrev` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `(주)ABC`, `㈜ABC`, `(주) 삼성전자` |
| 4 | `entities.ko-legal-other` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `유한회사 X`, `사단법인 Y`, `재단법인 Z`, `협동조합 W` |
| 5 | `entities.ko-title-name` | `["ko"]` | P | `대표이사 김철수`, `이사 박영희`, `팀장 이지훈` |
| 6 | `entities.ko-honorific` | `["ko"]` | P | `김철수 님`, `박영희 씨`, `홍길동 귀하` |
| 7 | `entities.en-corp-suffix` | `["en"]` | S, P | `ABC Corp`, `ABC Inc.`, `ABC LLC`, `ABC Ltd.`, `ABC Company` |
| 8 | `entities.en-legal-form` | `["en"]` | S, P | `ABC GmbH`, `XYZ S.A.`, `DEF Pty Ltd`, `GHI PLC` |
| 9 | `entities.en-title-person` | `["en"]` | P | `Mr. Smith`, `Dr. Jones`, `Prof. Anderson` |
| 10 | `entities.en-exec-title` | `["en"]` | P | `CEO John Smith`, `President Jane Doe`, `Director Kim` |
| 11 | `entities.ko-identity-context` | `["ko"]` | S, P | `대표자: 김철수`, `법인명: 삼성전자`, `상호 ABC` |
| 12 | `entities.en-identity-context` | `["en"]` | S, P | `Name: John Smith`, `Company: ABC Inc.`, `Signatory: Jane Doe` |

Legend: **S** = standard, **P** = paranoid. No conservative tier in this category — every rule has enough ambiguity that paranoid review is appropriate.

### 11.2 Normalization and anti-pattern notes

Same normalization assumptions as § 9.2 / § 10.2. One additional concern specific to entities:

**RULES_GUIDE § 12.2 — hardcoded entity names is an anti-pattern.** Every rule in this section uses CATEGORY markers (`주식회사`, `Corp`, `대표이사`) to identify entity-shaped spans; none hardcode specific company or person names (`Samsung`, `Apple`, `김철수`). If you feel tempted to add `삼성` or `LG` to an alternation for better recall, STOP. That would turn the rulebook into a database and break entity generalization. The correct place for entity-specific tuning is the `propagation/` lane (user-provided seed list), not the regex layer.

**RULES_GUIDE § 12.1 — `\b` in CJK contexts is an anti-pattern.** The Korean rules below use `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])` and `(?![가-힣])` instead of `\b`. Do NOT replace them with `\b`. English rules use `\b` where appropriate (they run under the `"en"` language filter so CJK text never reaches them).

**Known false positive pattern.** The Korean honorific rule (`ko-honorific`) and title-name rule (`ko-title-name`) both use `[가-힣]{2,4}` to detect name-shaped spans. This pattern legitimately matches common Korean words that are not names (e.g., `오늘 씨` = "today mister", `시간 님` = "time sir"). These false positives are intentionally NOT filtered at the regex layer. The heuristic phase (§ 14) applies a role blacklist that suppresses common-word false positives downstream. Regex stays context-free; heuristics add context.

### 11.3 Full file content (`rules/entities.ts`)

Put this EXACTLY into `src/detection/rules/entities.ts`:

```typescript
/**
 * Entities category — corporate forms, executive titles, honorifics, labels.
 *
 * Twelve regex rules covering:
 *
 *   1. Korean corporation with 주식회사 prefix
 *   2. Korean corporation with 주식회사 suffix
 *   3. Korean corporation abbreviation ((주) or ㈜)
 *   4. Korean legal forms other than 주식회사 (유한회사 / 사단법인 / ...)
 *   5. Korean executive title + person name
 *   6. Korean person name + honorific
 *   7. English corporation with Corp/Inc/LLC/Ltd/Co suffix
 *   8. English international legal form (GmbH/S.A./PLC/Pty Ltd/...)
 *   9. English personal title (Mr./Mrs./Dr./Prof.) + name
 *  10. English executive title (CEO/President/Director/...) + name
 *  11. Korean label-driven identity context (대표자:/법인명:/...)
 *  12. English label-driven identity context (Name:/Company:/...)
 *
 * No post-filters in this category. Entity detection is inherently fuzzy and
 * context-aware suppression is deferred to the heuristic phase (see § 14 of
 * phase-1-rulebook.md for the role blacklist design).
 *
 * See:
 *   - docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md § 11 — authoritative rule specs
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 2.4 — entities category boundary
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 12.1 — \b in CJK anti-pattern (avoided below)
 *   - docs/RULES_GUIDE.md § 12.2 — hardcoded entity names anti-pattern
 *
 * NORMALIZATION: this file assumes `normalizeForMatching` has already folded
 * fullwidth ASCII, CJK space, and hyphen variants. See § 11.2 of the phase-1
 * brief and src/detection/normalize.ts for the authoritative list.

### 11.4 Per-rule deep dive

#### 11.4.1 `entities.ko-corp-prefix`

**Pattern:** `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])주식회사\s+(?:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*|[가-힣][가-힣A-Za-z0-9]*)`

**Left boundary `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])`.** Prevents matching mid-word. `"X주식회사"` (no space) is caught by `ko-corp-suffix`, not here. `"한국주식회사"` — the `한` before `주` is Hangul, lookbehind fails, no prefix match. Correct: this is the suffix form, caught by rule 2.

**Company name token.** Two branches: English/digit start `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*`, or Korean start `[가-힣][가-힣A-Za-z0-9]*`. The name is a single whitespace-free token — multi-word Korean company names (`"주식회사 홍길동 컴퍼니"`) truncate to `"주식회사 홍길동"`. Acknowledged limitation.

**Matches:**
- `"주식회사 LG"` → `주식회사 LG`
- `"주식회사 삼성전자"` → `주식회사 삼성전자`
- `"주식회사 3M"` → `주식회사 3M`

**Rejects:**
- `"주식회사"` alone (no name) — no match
- `"홍길동 주식회사"` — caught by `ko-corp-suffix`, not this rule
- `"㈜LG"` — caught by `ko-corp-abbrev`, not this rule

**ReDoS:** benign. No nested quantifiers, single alternation branch chosen by the first character class.

#### 11.4.2 `entities.ko-corp-suffix`

**Pattern:** `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])(?:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*|[가-힣][가-힣A-Za-z0-9]*)\s+주식회사(?![가-힣A-Za-z])`

**Right boundary `(?![가-힣A-Za-z])`.** Prevents matching `"ABC 주식회사법인"` (company+suffix+other-word) as `"ABC 주식회사"` leaving `"법인"`. Actually accepts this — the right boundary sees `법` (Hangul), fails, no match at this position. That's probably wrong. Let me reconsider: in `"ABC 주식회사법인"`, the literal `주식회사` is followed by `법`. If we do NOT want to match here, the right boundary correctly rejects. Good.

**Matches:**
- `"LG 주식회사"` → `LG 주식회사`
- `"삼성전자 주식회사"` → `삼성전자 주식회사`
- `"3M 주식회사"` → `3M 주식회사`

**Rejects:**
- `"주식회사 LG"` — caught by prefix rule, not this
- `"주식회사"` alone — no match (no preceding token)
- `"주식회사법"` — no preceding space-separated token

**Rule interaction with prefix.** `"주식회사 LG 주식회사"` (weird but constructible) matches BOTH rules: prefix captures `주식회사 LG`, suffix captures `LG 주식회사`. Two candidates, different text strings, both emitted. Dedup happens later only on identical text.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.3 `entities.ko-corp-abbrev`

**Pattern:** `(?:\(주\)|㈜)\s*(?:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*|[가-힣][가-힣A-Za-z0-9]*)`

**Two abbreviation forms:** the ASCII `(주)` (three codepoints) and the single-codepoint `㈜` (U+3229). Both are common in Korean documents; some editors auto-convert one to the other.

**Matches:**
- `"(주)LG"` → `(주)LG`
- `"㈜LG"` → `㈜LG`
- `"(주) 삼성전자"` (space after abbrev) → `(주) 삼성전자`
- `"㈜삼성전자"` (no space) → `㈜삼성전자`

**Rejects:**
- `"(주)"` alone — no match
- `"(주식)LG"` — `\(주식\)` is not in the alternation, no match

**No left boundary needed.** The `(` and `㈜` characters are strong left anchors — no other word context produces them.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.4 `entities.ko-legal-other`

**Pattern:** `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])(?:유한회사|유한책임회사|합자회사|합명회사|사단법인|재단법인|협동조합)\s+(?:[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*|[가-힣][가-힣A-Za-z0-9]*)`

**Legal form list:** 7 forms covering the most common non-주식회사 Korean legal entities. Excluded: 영농조합법인, 농업회사법인 (agricultural-specific), 특수법인 (too generic). A future hygiene pass may extend.

**Alternation order.** `유한책임회사` before `유한회사` is critical — otherwise the engine matches the shorter form first on `"유한책임회사 ABC"` and would capture `"유한회사 ABC"` (wrong).

**Matches:**
- `"유한회사 홍길동"` → `유한회사 홍길동`
- `"유한책임회사 ABC"` → `유한책임회사 ABC`
- `"사단법인 한국언어학회"` — name truncates to `"사단법인 한국언어학회"` (single token)
- `"재단법인 ABC"` → `재단법인 ABC`

**Rejects:**
- `"유한회사"` alone (no name) — no match
- `"사단법"` (incomplete) — no match

**Level:** Standard + Paranoid. No conservative because non-주식회사 forms are rarer and the name token truncation occasionally produces incomplete matches.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.5 `entities.ko-title-name`

**Pattern:** `(?<![가-힣A-Za-z])(?:대표이사|부사장|본부장|대표|부장|차장|과장|팀장|실장|사장|전무|상무|이사|감사|대리|주임)\s+[가-힣]{2,4}(?![가-힣])`

**Title list:** 15 common Korean executive and management titles. Excluded: 이사장, 원장, 총무, 회계 (more specific roles) — add in a future hygiene pass.

**Alternation order.** `대표이사` before `대표` is critical. Same `유한책임회사`-before-`유한회사` rule.

**Name shape `[가-힣]{2,4}`.** Korean names are typically 2-4 Hangul syllables (2: 김수, 3: 김철수, 4: 선우재덕). The upper bound of 4 covers > 99% of real names.

**Right boundary `(?![가-힣])`.** Prevents the regex from stopping mid-name on a 5+ syllable name (rare, not supported).

**Matches:**
- `"대표이사 김철수"` → `대표이사 김철수`
- `"이사 박영희"` → `이사 박영희`
- `"팀장 이지훈"` → `팀장 이지훈`
- `"과장 홍길동"` → `과장 홍길동`

**Rejects:**
- `"대표이사"` alone — no match (no following name)
- `"대표이사 김"` — `[가-힣]{2,4}` requires at least 2 syllables, no match
- `"대표이사 김철수민준"` (5 syllables) — regex matches 4 then lookahead fails, overall no match

**Known false positive:** `"팀장 시간"` (time) — `"시간"` is 2 Hangul syllables and not a name, but regex matches. Suppressed downstream by the role blacklist in § 14.

**Level:** Paranoid only. Name detection is inherently low-precision; conservative and standard tiers skip this.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.6 `entities.ko-honorific`

**Pattern:** `(?<![가-힣])[가-힣]{2,4}\s*(?:사장님|선생님|교수님|대표님|이사님|귀하|님|씨)(?![가-힣])`

**Honorific list.** Generic: 님, 씨, 귀하. Title-embedded: 사장님, 선생님, 교수님, 대표님, 이사님. Alternation order: longer forms first (the three-syllable 사장님 etc. before the single-syllable 님).

**Matches:**
- `"김철수 님"` → `김철수 님`
- `"김철수님"` (no space) → `김철수님`
- `"박영희 씨"` → `박영희 씨`
- `"홍길동 귀하"` → `홍길동 귀하`
- `"김대표 사장님"` → `김대표 사장님`

**Rejects:**
- `"님"` alone — no match
- `"김"` (1 syllable before honorific) — `{2,4}` requires ≥ 2, no match

**Known false positive:** `"오늘 씨"` (today mister), `"시간 님"` (time sir) — common Korean words match as names. Suppressed downstream by role blacklist. Documented in § 11.2.

**Level:** Paranoid only. Same rationale as `ko-title-name`.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.7 `entities.en-corp-suffix`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9&\-]*(?:\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z0-9&\-]*){0,3}\s+(?:Corporation|Incorporated|Limited|Company|Corp\.?|Inc\.?|LLC\.?|Ltd\.?|Co\.?)(?![A-Za-z])`

**Name shape:** 1-4 capitalized words, each starting with `[A-Z]` followed by letters/digits/`&`/`-`.

**Suffix alternation.** Full words (Corporation, Incorporated, Limited, Company) before abbreviations (Corp, Inc, LLC, Ltd, Co). Each abbreviation has optional period (`Corp\.?`) so both `"ABC Corp"` and `"ABC Corp."` match.

**Why `{0,3}` not `{0,4}`.** 4-word company names exist but are rare. Capping at 4 total words (1 required + 3 optional) keeps the regex bounded and prevents runaway matching on long title-case sentences (e.g., a section heading `"The Big Brown Fox Jumped Over Corp"` would NOT match because it exceeds the cap).

**Matches:**
- `"ABC Corp"` → `ABC Corp`
- `"ABC Inc."` → `ABC Inc.`
- `"Apple Inc."` → `Apple Inc.`
- `"Acme Holdings LLC"` → `Acme Holdings LLC`
- `"International Business Machines Corp"` (3 words + Corp, 4 total) → full match
- `"ABC Corporation"` (full word) → `ABC Corporation`

**Rejects:**
- `"abc corp"` (lowercase name) — `[A-Z]` requires capital first char, no match
- `"Corp"` alone — no preceding capitalized word
- `"The company said"` — `"company"` is lowercase, no match

**Known false positive:** `"The Supreme Court Inc"` — `"The Supreme Court"` is 3 capitalized words followed by `Inc`. Matches. Rare but possible.

**Level:** Standard + Paranoid.

**ReDoS:** benign. The `{0,3}` bound limits backtracking to at most 4 positions per start.

#### 11.4.8 `entities.en-legal-form`

**Pattern:** see § 11.3. Identical name shape to `en-corp-suffix`, different suffix list.

**Legal form list:** 15 international forms. `GmbH`, `AG` (Germany); `S.p.A.`, `S.r.l.` (Italy); `S.A.S`, `S.A.`, `SARL`, `SAS` (France); `PLC`, `LLP` (UK); `Pty Ltd`, `Pty` (Australia); `NV`, `BV` (Netherlands); `AB` (Sweden); `OY` (Finland); `KG`, `OHG` (Germany).

**Alternation order.** Longer forms first: `S.p.A.` before `S.A.`, `Pty Ltd` before `Pty`. The `Pty\s+Ltd` branch requires literal whitespace between `Pty` and `Ltd`.

**Matches:**
- `"ABC GmbH"` → `ABC GmbH`
- `"Deutsche Bank AG"` → `Deutsche Bank AG`
- `"Alpha S.A."` → `Alpha S.A.`
- `"Beta Pty Ltd"` → `Beta Pty Ltd`
- `"Gamma PLC"` → `Gamma PLC`
- `"Delta Holdings NV"` → `Delta Holdings NV`

**Rejects:**
- `"PLC"` alone — no preceding word
- `"abc gmbh"` (lowercase) — no match

**Rule interaction with `en-corp-suffix`.** `"ABC Ltd."` matches `en-corp-suffix` via `Ltd\.?`. `"ABC Pty Ltd"` matches `en-legal-form` via `Pty\s+Ltd`. No overlap — both rules emit independent candidates when both match.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.9 `entities.en-title-person`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])(?:Mr|Mrs|Ms|Miss|Dr|Prof|Rev|Sir)\.?\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){0,2}(?![A-Za-z])`

**Title list:** 8 personal titles. `Mr`, `Mrs`, `Ms`, `Miss`, `Dr`, `Prof`, `Rev`, `Sir`. Optional period after the title (both `"Mr Smith"` and `"Mr. Smith"` match).

**Name shape `[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){0,2}`.** 1-3 name parts, each a capitalized word with lowercase continuation. Matches `"Smith"`, `"John Smith"`, `"John Paul Smith"` but NOT `"McDonald"` (internal capital — acknowledged limitation, could be extended to `[A-Z][a-z]+(?:[A-Z][a-z]+)*` for camelCase names in a future hygiene pass).

**Matches:**
- `"Mr. Smith"` → `Mr. Smith`
- `"Mr Smith"` (no period) → `Mr Smith`
- `"Dr. Jane Doe"` → `Dr. Jane Doe`
- `"Prof. Anderson"` → `Prof. Anderson`
- `"Rev. John Paul Smith"` → `Rev. John Paul Smith`

**Rejects:**
- `"Mr."` alone — no match
- `"Mr. smith"` (lowercase name) — `[A-Z]` required, no match
- `"MR. SMITH"` (all caps) — second char `R` is not `[a-z]`, fails the name shape, no match. ALL-CAPS is an acknowledged limitation.

**Level:** Paranoid only. Title-name detection has non-trivial false positive rate on ordinary prose.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.10 `entities.en-exec-title`

**Pattern:** `(?<![A-Za-z])(?:Vice\s+President|CEO|CFO|COO|CTO|CIO|CMO|CHRO|President|Chairman|Chairwoman|Director|Founder|Partner|Secretary|Treasurer)\s+[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){0,2}(?![A-Za-z])`

**Title list.** C-suite acronyms (CEO/CFO/...), English titles (President, Chairman, Director, Founder, Partner), corporate officers (Secretary, Treasurer). `Vice President` is a two-word title requiring `\s+` between words.

**Alternation order.** `Vice\s+President` before `President` (otherwise `"Vice President John"` would capture only `"President John"`). Confirmed via test case below.

**Matches:**
- `"CEO John Smith"` → `CEO John Smith`
- `"President Jane Doe"` → `President Jane Doe`
- `"Vice President Kamala Harris"` → `Vice President Kamala Harris`
- `"Director Kim Park"` → `Director Kim Park`
- `"Founder Marc Zuckerberg"` → `Founder Marc Zuckerberg`
- `"Chairman Jack Ma"` → `Chairman Jack Ma`

**Rejects:**
- `"CEO"` alone — no following name
- `"Director of Sales"` — `"of"` is lowercase, name shape fails, no match
- `"President Obama"` — matches correctly (`Obama` is one capitalized word)

**Level:** Paranoid only.

**ReDoS:** benign.

#### 11.4.11 `entities.ko-identity-context`

**Pattern:** `(?<=(?:대표자|성명|이름|법인명|회사명|상호|소속|직함|직위)\s*[:：]?\s*)(?:[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*|[가-힣]{2,6})`

**Label list:** 9 Korean identity labels. `대표자`, `성명`, `이름`, `법인명`, `회사명`, `상호`, `소속`, `직함`, `직위`.

**Variable-length lookbehind.** Same caveat as § 9.4.10 and § 10.4.8: ES2018+, supported in Node 18+, bounded cost (longest label is 3 Hangul syllables plus optional punctuation plus whitespace).

**Value shape.** Either an English/digit token (`[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9&.\-]*`) or a 2-6 syllable Korean token (`[가-힣]{2,6}`). The upper bound of 6 covers most Korean company names; longer names truncate.

**Matches:**
- `"대표자: 김철수"` → `김철수` (label consumed by lookbehind)
- `"법인명: 삼성전자"` → `삼성전자`
- `"회사명 ABC"` → `ABC`
- `"상호: (주)홍길동"` — the lookbehind matches `"상호: "`, but then `(주)홍길동` starts with `(` which is NOT in the value character class. No match for this specific string. Acknowledged limitation — `상호` labels with `(주)` prefix are caught by `ko-corp-abbrev` rule instead, so no candidate is lost.

**Rejects:**
- `"대표자"` alone — no value
- `"이름 홍길동 씨"` — matches only `홍길동`; the `씨` is left over and caught by `ko-honorific`

**ReDoS:** bounded. Variable-length lookbehind scans back a fixed maximum of ~10 characters.

#### 11.4.12 `entities.en-identity-context`

**Pattern:** `(?<=(?:Full\s+Name|Company\s+Name|Name|Company|Representative|Contact|Signatory|Client|Counterparty)\s*:\s*)[A-Z][A-Za-z.\-]*(?:\s+[A-Z][A-Za-z.\-]*){0,3}`

**Label list:** 9 English identity labels. Compound forms (`Full Name`, `Company Name`) before single-word forms (`Name`, `Company`) in the alternation so the engine prefers the longer match.

**Required colon after label.** `\s*:\s*` in the lookbehind — English forms almost always use colons, unlike Korean where colons are optional. Forms without colons (e.g., `"Name John Smith"` written as a table cell) do NOT match. Acknowledged limitation.

**Value shape.** 1-4 capitalized words, each `[A-Z][A-Za-z.\-]*` — allows internal periods and hyphens (e.g., `"J.P. Morgan"`, `"Jean-Paul"`).

**Matches:**
- `"Name: John Smith"` → `John Smith`
- `"Full Name: Jane Doe"` → `Jane Doe`
- `"Company: Acme Corp"` → `Acme Corp`
- `"Signatory: J.P. Morgan"` → `J.P. Morgan`
- `"Client: Alpha Beta Gamma Delta"` (4 words) → full match

**Rejects:**
- `"Name"` alone — no value
- `"Name: john smith"` (lowercase) — first char must be `[A-Z]`, no match
- `"Name John Smith"` (no colon) — lookbehind requires colon, no match

**ReDoS:** bounded. Variable-length lookbehind maximum is `"Company Name: "` (~14 chars), name repetition is capped at 4.

### 11.5 Test file specification (`rules/entities.test.ts`)

Create `src/detection/rules/entities.test.ts`. Per RULES_GUIDE § 8.1, minimum per-rule test set is 13 cases. Twelve rules × 13 tests = **156 tests minimum**. Target ~170 tests to cover alternation-order gotchas (대표이사 vs 대표, Vice President vs President, 유한책임회사 vs 유한회사) with explicit regression tests.

**Organization:** mirror § 9.5 / § 10.5 exactly. Shared helpers copied from § 9.5 with `ENTITIES` substituted for `FINANCIAL`. One registry-sanity describe block, then one describe per rule.

**Alternation-order regression tests.** Every rule with ordered alternations (1, 4, 5, 10) gets an explicit test that the longer form takes precedence:

```typescript
describe("entities.ko-title-name", () => {
  // ... 12 other tests ...

  it("prefers 대표이사 over 대표 when both could match", () => {
    // If alternation order were wrong, the match would be "대표 이사" — the
    // regex would consume "대표" and fail to reach "이사" as a separate title.
    expect(matchOne("ko-title-name", "대표이사 김철수")).toEqual([
      "대표이사 김철수",
    ]);
  });
});

describe("entities.ko-legal-other", () => {
  // ... 12 other tests ...

  it("prefers 유한책임회사 over 유한회사 when both could match", () => {
    expect(matchOne("ko-legal-other", "유한책임회사 ABC")).toEqual([
      "유한책임회사 ABC",
    ]);
  });
});

describe("entities.en-exec-title", () => {
  // ... 12 other tests ...

  it("prefers 'Vice President' over 'President' when both could match", () => {
    expect(matchOne("en-exec-title", "Vice President Kamala Harris")).toEqual([
      "Vice President Kamala Harris",
    ]);
  });
});
```

**Role blacklist context.** Because § 14's role blacklist will suppress false positives downstream, the entities test file SHOULD include tests that verify the regex DOES match common-word false positives (like `"오늘 씨"`). These tests confirm that the regex is deliberately context-free — the assertion is that the regex matches, NOT that the user sees the match in the final output:

```typescript
it("matches common-word false positives as a regex-layer candidate (suppressed downstream by role blacklist)", () => {
  // This is intentional: regex is context-free; heuristics apply the blacklist.
  expect(matchOne("ko-honorific", "오늘 씨")).toEqual(["오늘 씨"]);
});
```

This test is a contract between the regex layer and the heuristic layer: the regex declares "I will emit this false positive; the heuristic phase is responsible for filtering it." Removing the test without updating the heuristic layer would silently break the contract.

**ReDoS adversarial test per rule.** One per rule, following § 9.5 / § 10.5 template.

### 11.6 Registry integration

Extend `src/detection/_framework/registry.ts`:

```typescript
// Before (§ 10 state):
import { FINANCIAL } from "../rules/financial.js";
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
import { TEMPORAL } from "../rules/temporal.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  ...FINANCIAL,
  ...TEMPORAL,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...ENTITIES  (§ 11)
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;

// After (§ 11 commit):
import { ENTITIES } from "../rules/entities.js";
import { FINANCIAL } from "../rules/financial.js";
import { IDENTIFIERS } from "../rules/identifiers.js";
import { TEMPORAL } from "../rules/temporal.js";

export const ALL_REGEX_RULES: readonly RegexRule[] = [
  ...IDENTIFIERS,
  ...FINANCIAL,
  ...TEMPORAL,
  ...ENTITIES,
  // Phase 1 follow-up commits append:
  //   ...LEGAL     (§ 13)
] as const;
```

### 11.7 Acceptance checklist for § 11

- [ ] `src/detection/rules/entities.ts` exists and exports `ENTITIES: readonly RegexRule[]`
- [ ] `ENTITIES.length === 12`
- [ ] Every rule's id starts with `"entities."`
- [ ] Every rule has `category: "entities"`
- [ ] Every rule's pattern has the `g` flag
- [ ] NO rules in ENTITIES have post-filters (entity detection is context-free at the regex layer; context-aware suppression is deferred to § 14 heuristics)
- [ ] Alternation order is correct: `대표이사` before `대표` (rule 5); `유한책임회사` before `유한회사` (rule 4); `Vice\s+President` before `President` (rule 10); longer personal titles before shorter (rule 9 uses all single-token titles so no concern there); longer honorific forms before shorter (rule 6: `사장님` before `님`)
- [ ] Rule 2 (`ko-corp-suffix`) has right boundary `(?![가-힣A-Za-z])` to prevent `"X주식회사법인"` false match
- [ ] Rule 3 (`ko-corp-abbrev`) matches BOTH `(주)` and `㈜` forms
- [ ] `rules/entities.test.ts` has ≥ 156 tests, all passing
- [ ] `rules/entities.test.ts` has alternation-order regression tests for rules 4, 5, 6, 10
- [ ] `rules/entities.test.ts` has common-word false-positive tests documenting the regex→heuristic contract (see § 11.5)
- [ ] Every describe block earns ★★★ on the quality rubric
- [ ] No rule uses `\b` in a pattern with Hangul (RULES_GUIDE § 12.1 anti-pattern)
- [ ] No rule hardcodes a specific company or person name (RULES_GUIDE § 12.2 anti-pattern)
- [ ] Registry update: `ALL_REGEX_RULES` includes `...ENTITIES` immediately after `...TEMPORAL`
- [ ] Registry verification passes at module load
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.characterization.test.ts` still passes byte-for-byte
- [ ] `bun run test src/detection/detect-pii.integration.test.ts` still passes
- [ ] `bun run test` overall test count increases by ≥ 156 in this commit
- [ ] ReDoS guard fuzz passes for all 12 entity rules (variable-length lookbehind rules 11, 12 must pass the 50ms budget)
- [ ] No new npm dependencies
- [ ] No edits to any Phase 0 file other than `registry.ts`

### Decisions locked during plan-eng-review (DO NOT RE-OPEN)

See `../document-redactor-private-notes/session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md` for the full review record. Summary:

| Ref | Decision | One-line rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **1.1A** | Strangler-fig — new `detect-all.ts`, legacy untouched, `engine.ts` migration in final commit | Preserves Phase 0 characterization T1–T18 ship gate byte-for-byte |
| **1.2A** | Rename `DefinedTerm` → `StructuralDefinition` in framework (done in commit 187b7f8) | Avoids name collision with `propagation/defined-terms.ts` |
| **1.3D** | Phase 1 is detection-only; UI redesign in separate brief after Phase 1 merge + empirical data | Rule quality validated on real contracts before UI groups are designed |
| **1.4E-1** | Fail-loud — no try/catch in runner/parser/heuristic invocation | Zero-miss invariant (design-v1 Lock-in #15), matches v1.0 behavior |
| **1.5** | ReDoS guard extended to structural parsers (100ms budget) and heuristics (100ms budget) in addition to regex rules (50ms) | Parsers/heuristics can have internal regexes with backtracking |
| **2.1** | `HeuristicContext` is the only context type (no `RegexContext` or `StructuralContext`) | DRY — regex phase is stateless, structural phase runs first with no context |
| **2.2** | File splits: financial/temporal/entities/legal are single files; structural/heuristics use subdirectory layout with `index.ts` aggregation | Keeps per-file LOC under ~500 without inventing abstractions for small files |
| **2.3** | Registry imports are explicit, not auto-discovered | Same pattern as Phase 0 registry.ts — explicit import + load-time verify |
| **2.4** | `stop-phrases.ts` stays untouched; TODO noted to consolidate with `role-blacklist-*` post-Phase-1 | Different purposes (keyword suggester noise vs heuristic role filter) |
| **2.5** | ASCII diagrams mandatory in top-of-file JSDoc for runner.ts and detect-all.ts | User engineering preference + design-v1 documentation standard |

### Plan-eng-review outputs (all resolved)

- Step 0: **Scope accepted** (complexity triggered at 22+ files but domain-appropriate for rulebook work)
- Architecture: **5 findings, all resolved** (1.1A / 1.2A / 1.3D / 1.4E-1 / 1.5)
- Code Quality: **5 findings, all inline** (2.1–2.5)
- Test Review: **475 planned tests, 0 gaps**, fail-loud convention in test harness
- Performance: **4 items**, perf-budget test added to verification commands
- NOT in scope: **10 items** documented
- What already exists: **12 reuse points**
- TODOs: **7 items** noted in session log
- Failure modes: **9 audited, 0 critical gaps**
- Parallelization: **4 lanes**, informational only (Codex is single-session)
- Lake Score: **10/10** (every choice chose the complete option)

### User insight captured and parked (UI add/remove UX)

During review, user flagged a critical product insight not yet addressed:

> "under cover 되서 유저가 키워드를 추가 하는 경우도 있는데 over cover되서 유저가 키워드를 빼야 하는 경우도 있어서..그것도 모두 화면+기능에 반영해주면 좋을거 같아. 디자인 구성을 잘해야 할듯.. 추가하는거 빼는거 잘 구분되게"

The insight is captured in the UI redesign brief scope (deferred per 1.3D). Draft UI structure (category-grouped sections with `[+ 추가]` per category, confidence-sorted "추측" section, over/under cover visual distinction) is sketched in session log 2026-04-11-v2 § "Finding 1.3 — user insight" for the future UI redesign brief.

Phase 1 brief does NOT address UI. It only ensures `engine.ts` adds `nonPiiCandidates` so a future UI can render what's there.

### Next session startup checklist

1. Open this file and confirm the "PARTIAL DRAFT" warning is still at the top — it should now say "§ 0–11 written".
2. Read `../document-redactor-private-notes/session-log-2026-04-11-v2.md` for the full review context.
3. Read the 4 external feedback files in repo root (`ChatGPT 5.4 Pro Feedback_1.md`, `_2.md`, `Codex Feedback.md`) — these are the quality bar for rule authoring, especially for § 12–14 per-category rule drafting.
4. Verify `git log --oneline -8` shows the session-+1 / +2 / +3 commits adding § 6–11 after `e41d842 docs(phases): start phase-1 rulebook brief §0-5 (PARTIAL DRAFT)`.
5. Verify `bun run test` still shows 422 passing (Phase 0 has not been executed by Codex yet — these are still the v1.0 legacy tests).
6. **Before starting § 12:** read RULES_GUIDE § 5 (Writing a structural parser) carefully. Structural parsers have a DIFFERENT shape from regex rules — they export a `parse(text)` function, return `StructuralDefinition[]` not `Candidate[]`, and are not level-filtered. Model § 12.1 through § 12.5 on RULES_GUIDE § 5's example parser. Then write § 12 (structural parsers, ~900) → § 13 (legal, ~400 — same shape as § 9/10/11, easy) → § 14 (heuristics, ~700 — requires RULES_GUIDE § 6 as reference).
7. After each section: `wc -l docs/phases/phase-1-rulebook.md`, commit with a message like `docs(phases): phase-1 brief § 11 entities rules (partial)`.
8. Continue across sessions until every section is written, then remove the "PARTIAL DRAFT" warning at the top as the final commit of the brief-authoring stream.

### Do NOT in future sessions

- Do NOT re-run plan-eng-review on this brief. The review is complete.
- Do NOT rewrite § 0–11. They are locked. § 6–8 specify exact TypeScript for the framework extension surface. § 9 specifies exact regex sources for the 10 financial rules. § 10 specifies exact regex sources for the 8 temporal rules plus the `isValidCalendarDate` / `validNumericDate` / `validEnglishDate` post-filters. § 11 specifies exact regex sources for the 12 entity rules with deliberately context-free semantics (role-blacklist suppression happens in § 14 heuristics, not here). Do not "improve", "tune", rename, or refactor any of these without a ReDoS re-audit and a plan-eng-review re-opener.
- Do NOT hand the brief to Codex until the "PARTIAL DRAFT" warning is removed.
- Do NOT commit Phase 1 content changes to `src/` in the same session as brief authoring. This is a doc-only stream until the brief is complete.
- Do NOT modify the Phase 0 brief again after commit 187b7f8. It is locked for Codex execution.
