/**
 * PII regex patterns — Korean + English (Lane A core).
 *
 * Each pattern is bounded (no nested quantifiers, no catastrophic backtracking)
 * and runs against the **normalized** text — i.e. callers should
 * `normalizeForMatching()` first so that fullwidth digits, smart quotes, en
 * dashes, and zero-width chars don't cause silent misses.
 *
 * Patterns are intentionally conservative: false positives are recoverable
 * (the user reviews candidates before applying redactions in Lane C; the
 * worst case is one extra item in the candidate list). False negatives are
 * NOT recoverable (silent leak), so when in doubt we prefer broader matches.
 *
 * The redactor (Lane B) treats every match as a literal substring to scrub
 * via the cross-run coalescer, so patterns do not need to participate in any
 * higher-level alias resolution. They produce raw target strings.
 *
 * The full set of supported kinds is exported as `PII_KINDS` for callers
 * (and tests) that want to iterate.
