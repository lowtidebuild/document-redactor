/**
 * Round-trip verifier — the zero-miss safety net.
 *
 * Eng review lock-in #2: after every redaction pipeline run, the OUTPUT
 * DOCX is re-parsed, every text-bearing scope is walked, and every string
 * in the original sensitive list is searched for. If even one survived,
 * the download is BLOCKED and the user is shown which strings, in which
 * scopes, escaped the redactor.
 *
 * This is the mechanism that converts the redactor's regex imperfection
 * into a *detectable* error instead of a silent leak. It is the single
 * most important non-invariant safety mechanism in the entire product.
 *
 * Critical property: this verifier intentionally does NOT trust the redactor
 * that produced the output. It re-loads the bytes from scratch, walks the
 * scopes via the same scope walker the redactor uses, and searches with
 * plain string indexOf — no regex, no normalization, no clever tricks. It
 * is the dumbest, most direct check we can possibly run, and that is the
 * point: if anything in the redactor pipeline is wrong (a regex bug, a
 * coalescer bug, a missed scope), this verifier catches it.
 *
 * Public API:
 *   - verifyRedaction(zip, sensitiveStrings) → VerifyResult
 *     Walks every text-bearing scope and reports any sensitive string that
 *     survived. Empty `survived` array means a clean output.
 *   - VerifyResult.isClean — convenience boolean for the ship gate.
